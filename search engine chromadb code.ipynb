main character is a cherry boy his female teacher seduces him at first  soon they start to indulge themselves in sampm play  wow  how do you come up with the storyline  i have several basic storylines  mothersinlaw teachers office ladies i pick a topic  there is also sampm play  the readers really enjoy my precise details  so i have the tendency to describe more in detail  i really enjoyed reading the novel called the burst of love  it was hardcore but also elegant  i was absorbed into the story when i wrote it  especially the description of the bondage was superb  ive collected data to study that  i also interviewed an expert in bondage  theres a lot of effort to write a book  i was embarrassed when i was called an authentic sampm novelist  kept thinking what if sampm fanatics read my novel  my story is based on my imagination  who knows you must have a lot of experience  i dont   of my stories are based on my imagination  well lets get started now  okay  ithe other  isi  ino way i wonder if he actually likes sampm playi  uehara look at this  im burning up  on the teachers podium  the hot vaginal secretions were oozing out  from misakos lustful body  takeshi couldnt believe the

 sighs ididnt you get the call from the officei  ithe show is canned richiei  iand theyre all pointing the finger at mei  iim the one whos unfit to look after my kidsi  just calm down  ijust leave it to me fi all right ill smooth it overi  door  smooth it over you bugged my house you shit  and they say im the cokehead  sighs  ruth the heat is on fi hansen and her stability as a mother  the last thing we need is for any more salacious details to get out  but it happens  im sorry  im presuming it was just the one time  yes  ruth well melanie is brutal but straight  so any footage they have of you and mrs hansen  we ask for it to be delivered up so it can be destroyed  it doesnt serve her client to be exposed as spying on his wife  no it points to a predilection for voyeurism   of which we know he has form zander agreed  but more than that it compounds the coercive behavior  i mean abusive behavior  hannah were currently trying to iron out the child arrangement situation  and he is not making it easy for us  i suspect hes leaking stories to the press to shows his wife in a bad light  sighs  its a mess  ruth well we can clean it up as elegantly as we can  there are enough stories circulating around him to surely   push back a little  yeah  hannah but none of them are making the press  we need to find the women who are willing to talk  offer legal protection to break their ndas  after the way the press annihilated the nanny  no ones willing to come out and say who richie hansen is  either way you cant be on this case anymore  agreed ruths going to take it over with hannah from here  zander  youve compromised yourself christie  you know how vulnerable she is   shes a grown woman  and you took advantage of that  so were done here  hey  just wondered if youd look over the hansen position statement  i changed a little of the wording  change it back  sorry  i just i thought it was a little clumsy  ive been doing this  years dont be clever  clarity over finesse  oh sorry sorry rewind  last para you were right cuts are great  nathan it turns out richie hansen planted cameras in the family home  hes bugging his wife  yeah well it happens  er weve gone in hard with his lawyers and threatened civil proceedings  i mean i i dont know if there would have been much on it  but its one way to keep track of your spouse  its the use of incriminating there must be something  nhd would have noted it as such  if there wasnt something worth shutting down  ill find out more  just for claritys sake  itouchi  nathan  ive left hannah   ok  it surprisingly is  really its been coming for a while im fine   where are you gonna stay  um  last night my sisterinlaws  but er probably best to draw territory lines away from family so   yeah  hotel   you can always  er no no no im fine  im a grownup single white male we know how to do these things  credit card toothbrush takeaway we travel light  just to clarify i wasnt asking you if you wanted to stay over  theres a noticeboard for flat rentals in the chambers bar  and as the yoot of today would say i can highly recommend spare room  yeah rub it in why dont you  im sorry  i am too  nathan but its not over till the fat lady sings   youve lost me now  fat lady   fat lady sings  no  its a turn of phrase fat lady fat lady sings  nathan oh get out of here with your bloody spare room and your airbnb  oh airbnb radical  hannah i know that youre angry your message was certainly clear  not only is it a massive infringement of my clients privacy  to knowingly record or film without permission  but you dont need me to also remind you that if you try and use any evidence  as leverage at the forthcoming child arrangements hearings  any judge will recognize it as unscrupulous  especially as it includes recordings of his own children at home and play  but you have to admit what it threw up was pretty titillating  melanie also its a little bit embarrassing for your colleague  with regards to my client i have to admit that i dont approve hannah  and were not going to be using it  but it doesnt put fi hansen in a very good light  clear examples of drugtaking compounded with a rather racy threeway  already in the public domain  i mean it asks questions  whether she has the ability to be able to focus on her children  fi hansen has not got a drug problem  i mean either way it wont play well with the judge  your client is orchestrating all this to his advantage  but the press can turn melanie  and they will turn quick given the right information  threats hannah  chuckles that is not your style  but you might want to be careful because mr hansen  is a little volatile right now because his children are everything  but your client failed to take his children to school this morning  we have both been in this business for long enough  to know that the likes of mr hansen  have a shroud of wealth and a retinue willing to cover up  and serve them  exactly so therell be a new show the next project  which no one will want to jeopardize a week from now  no melanie   thats the past  but is it  it is amazing what a couple of hundred grand wont do  to shut those girls up  oh anyway ive said it before those russian and tech billionaires  are just so much easier  we want all the footage  and well be making an application within these proceedings  for delivery up of all recordings  and to prohibit your client from using any of it  dramatic music playing  no audio  music continues playing  sighs   hey  hi  mr pope  not to put too fine a point on it hannah but a baby   my baby  right welcome home  not exactly not entirely sarahs gone ballistic  nice tan  how was la   amazing  nina your mess  youre pregnant  hello to you too  youre pregnant  yippitydoo  and its definitely mine  or the guy from uber eats who knows  yes you dick unfortunately its yours read the letter  should you even be carrying that  it was just a courtesy but if youd like a dna test  yeah i would  a legal letter  well what did you expect im a lawyer  i made it as easy as i could to read  and you dont want anything  er  no thanks youve done your job  so thats what it was  oh dont flatter yourself no it was three mojitos  and a good gag about your old headmaster that swung it  thanks ive kept that one in  and then you went back to your exwife  how is that going  that by which you mean sarah  the weather helps  oh congratulations by the way  your show   do you like it  no its pretty shit  sarahs not happy  you chose to go back to her  to be frank we might not stay  its tanked your shows tanked  thats not the point  god you do this you throw me off my point which is  a baby  yeah thats what im hoping well get at the end of this   wow  sighs its fine   its not fine  well its happening  ive

ive missed you  hey  eh  rex tyler  youre on that netflix thing my nephew loves it  how olds your nephew  er   fi stay calm  how long will the press run with this im everywhere  hes going to take my kids  the press are inferring at best that im a party girl   fi  hes going to capitalize on this  when he wants something he gets it   and he wants my kids  hes not going to get your kids  ruth is my colleague  shell be working with me now that christie has left the team   mrs hansen  bullshit bullshit  fi is this what you do  lure women like me into thinking they stand a chance  no  have you any idea what its like looking at your life ripped apart  exposed to the fact that your whole life has been a lie  can you imagine your life without your kids  fi no cos you dont have to youre not where im at  mrs hansen youre not going to lose your kids because he is not going to win  ruth because you are a good mother  because you have safely brought up three children so far  i presume theyre all at school today   yes  yes so look  anything that any newspaper says  is just the grease that turns the wheels of another press day  ruth so you breathe  you leave us to prepare your case and you trust in your lawyer  because she is good she is very good  sighs  hannah fi  we need to find women willing to go on record against your husband  push back that bad press where it belongs  have you spoken to ali  shes leaving  fi she texted me this morning i dont think richie knows yet  ah every time  ali   do we have a meeting booked in  no  youre leaving  yeah im terminating my interests   i really shouldnt be talking to you  then why did you leak the tape   like legally i cant talk to you  you signed an nda   cant  which you can break  yeah right  we will support you   look nhd can help

richie straight out of college  my entire career is based around that man  he actually wasnt born an arsehole its just people like me  make people like him feel that its all right to be one  i have spent the last decade cleaning up and sanitizing that mans life  thats what we do   and if i break that trust its  what what the sky will fall  i know youve been approached by the press   half of them are my mates  then talk to them  therere a million richies  we book every appointment  we bail them out with vit b shots and rehab  ali we buy presents for their kids  we prop them up on the red carpet  we smooth out the wrinkles and the loose talk  but were nobodies  im a nobody  so if i speak up i will be silenced   no client would ever trust me again  then get better clients get new clients  now you can keep smoothing out the creases smiling on red carpets  but life is coming for richie hansen  you wanna be a spectator  or do you wanna stop burying your head in the sand  look this thing straight in the eye and call it for what it is  but for once you can do something  change it change you  because you cant go back  so let me help you go forward  if you choose to talk weve got your back  dramatic music playing  indistinct conversation  rex is back   sounds like the title of a bad romcom i im seriousi  oh god i had a feeling you were  ii mean he was really sweeti  and

with them  well sure youll moan about them to one another laughs softly  but theyre your secret theyre  theyre part of the marriage nda  and  youll tell yourself that theyre the quirks that make you

isurvivori  for the past  days the yellow  tribe kota was the king of the  jungle winning eight out of ten  challenges  kota once again immunity is  yours  the entire tribe was united  except for dan and susie   i dont have the confidence  that we get to the merge and  these people have got my back   probst throughout the game  the red tribe fang  consistently made questionable  moves   im stuck in a tribe that has  no skills   probst ace made a headsup  play   thats the deal   deal   deal   probst when he pulled  matty into an alliance with his  longtime ally sugar   ive been relying on ace the  whole time   one of sugars biggest  plusses is the fact that she has  the immunity idol  and ive got sugar in my pocket   probst their first move was  to vote out aces biggest enemy  kelly  kelly the tribe has spoken   are left  who will be voted out tonight     animals chirping chittering  animal squawks in distance   this is a tough game  were starving   theres nothing to eat  im starting to lose my spirit  im starting to lose my hope  itsits become hopeless  im hopeless about fang   what happened   as soon as i got up it  tipped over  but just a little bit came out  but ill scoop it back in there  cause it it was just a  little bit   thats a ton  rice is more valuable than gold  and she just clumsily trips over  it and spills it  i wanted to just lay into her  and chew her out but i its  just pointless  you cant cry over spilled  milk you know  its just too late  is it done   yeah not so bad   you guys ready   nothing like some fresh  oatmeal rice   i dont want to take away  from you and matty   crystal eat   ace you eat   come on please   you dont have to beg me  you eat  i dont want to feel like i took  away from anybody in this tribe  so by all means eat your full  like you normally do   this tribe fang tribe were  not working together  everybody has grudges against  each other  matty and ace are basically  going against crystal  these guys are trying to call  the shots and i dont like  that i dont like that at all   you guys donti havei to say  anything but your faces say a  thousand words  thats the difference between me  and you guys   crystal did me a favor  she will be the next lamb to the  slaughter  captioning sponsored by  cbs paramount  network television  theme song playing     animal bellows    wwwopensubtitlesorg     my parents are like  corinne try not to curse so  much when youre there because  people are gonna think youre  trashy  laughter   i think charlie and marcus  and corinne seem very very  tight and at times almost  exclusive  and im just the type of person  that im always gonna feel a  little bit vulnerable a little  bit insecure  i mean i wanted to clarify that  im like a really sensitive  person   yeah   and its weird when im not  part of a group  i kind of like itit like  makes me feel bad a little bit  thats just me like thats how  i am with groups   yeah yeah   you know i like to be part  of the group   i would say that dan is  socially inept in a lot of ways  i dont know if hes a former  fatty or why he wasnt liked as  a child but deep down inside  hes a little kid thats seeking  approval   its different than fang  where i alienated myself because  i didnt like those people  with you guys its completely  opposite  its like all right i really  like these three   dan is the ultimate paranoid  human being  at some point dan is gonna be a  huge liability and  unfortunately theres nothing i  can do toto sort of save him  fromfrom himself at this point   do you feel better   yeah i do   okay   do you guys   yeah   all right good      probst come on in guys  kota getting your first look at  the new fang tribe  kelly voted out at the last  tribal council  all right you guys ready to get  to todays challenge   others oh yeah yeah   probst for todays  challenge gonna play a little  game of keepaway  on my go three members of  each tribe will toss a breakable  ball back and forth while one  member of the other tribe  attempts to smash that ball or  force it to the ground  youll be playing at the same  time in two rings  the tribe whose attacker breaks  their opponents ball first wins  a point  we are playing to three  want to know what youre playing  for   yeah   hell yeah   probst the winning tribe  will be picked up by helicopter  flown to a beautiful location  here in gabon  youll be bringing with you  everything you need for a nice  afternoon picnic  gasps   beer   beers   probst you have some bread  veggies meats cheeses   cheese   probst some nice drinks  it should be a fun afternoon  in addition the winning tribe  will send one member of the  losing tribe to exile island  worth playing for   others oh yeah yeah   probst kota you have two  extra members  whos gonna sit this one out  charlie and i would like to be  the cheerleaders today   probst corinne charlie  take a spot on the bench  everybody else ill give you a  minute to strategize well get  started  first round randy the attacker  for kota will be going up  against fang  ace the attacker for fang  hell be going up against kota  fang looking to break a  fivechallenge losing streak  survivors ready  go  ace goes after bob in the kota  ring  randy very aggressive in the  fang ring   yes   probst ball hits the ground  kota scores first point  cheering   yeah kota   over   probst kota leads onezip  next round bob the attacker  for kota sugar the attacker  for fang   growls   this guy is so ugly over  here  hes such an ugly person  hes mean   probst this should be fun   yeah   probst survivors ready  go  sugar being aggressive giving  everything she has trying to  score for fang  bob takes kenny out doesnt  help  fangs still alive  bob takes a hard fall  stay after him sugar  be a hero   laughs okay   probst fang needs to score  sugar you need to pick it up  do not drop that ball   grunts   probst big takedown from  bob  it doesnt work though ace  keeps the ball alive   nice ace   probst sugar doing  nothing absolutely nothing   come on sugar   probst sugars gonna have to  get aggressive try to make  something happen  bob almost deflects it  no another takedown by bob on  matty   laughing   come on sugar   probst ace tries to get it  past bob but bob shuts him  down  kota scores again  kota leads twozip  we are playing to three  this could be it  next round attacking for kota  is dan  he could end this challenge  attacking for fang is matty  trying to keep fang alive for a  big reward  survivors ready  go  matty comes out strong chasing  after that ball quickly  dan very aggressive on ace  ace gets rid of it to crystal  crystal to sugar back to ace  ace back to sugar no  dan causes the ball to break  kota scores  kota wins reward  excited chatter  all right kota big decision  youre sending one member of  fang to exile island   lets go ahead and send  sugar   probst sugar this is  unprecedented  i dont think weve ever had  anybody be sent to exile five  times backtobacktoback  tobacktoback   yeah im here to break  records you know laughs   probst all right sugar get  your stuff   sugar is a pinup model  she is completely worthless when  it comes to challenges  so when it comes to sugar in  this game i would really  really really desire her to go   probst kota it should be a  fun afternoon  indistinct chatter  fang i got nothing for you   we lost the biggest reward  yet  its hard you know when you  see them walking away  they have everything and we  have nothing  and we see kota in their  beautiful chopper just lavishing  in their reward you know  its madness its total  madness      reward was a helicopter ride  and i was lucky enough to have  ithei frontrow seat  just seeing that incredible  crater it made my trip to  africa  the only thing that was beating  faster than the rotors on that  helicopter was the beating of my  heart   oh wow   close as i want to get   holy cow   stay away from the edge   youre making me nervous  marcus  the beautiful scenery it was  awesome  its something i thought i would  never experience so it just  gives you more incentive more  power more strength to know  that you can get through this  no matter what  so it was very it was very  surreal for me  it was just amazing   lets get our blanket out   this is great lets get our  blanket out   sardines haha   i dont think in  my entire  years of living  ive ever been so embarrassed  im humiliated i felt pathetic  my spirits are dropping so fast  i look over and like sugar  shes just she cant do  anything  shes just being dominated  it was pointless for us to even  keep going  she was just standing there  getting walked all over  i hate it  im starting to get pissed  as long as theres physical  challenges were gonna lose  want to take a boat ride ace   sure bro   we need to take out sugar  okay this is what we do  we go kenny crystal and i vote  for sugar  you dont have to vote for  sugar so youre not  backstabbing her okay  sugars gone and its you and i  to the merge a hundred percent  theres no question   you know were a hundred  percent you and me   no i dont know that  were aligned  me and you are aligned so make  me comfortable  we need to take out sugar or at  least get the idol out   yeah i see the logic dude  i see that logic   okay we know exactly where  its sitting and we can use it  to our advantage when we have  to   you know what theyre  talking about right cri   yeah those two asses out  there in the boat trying to get  me off   they are will you trust me   ive been there with you  from day one kenny   we have to blindside ace   yeah   i have to talk to sugar  crystal you trust me a  hundred percent right   i trust you a hundred  percent   okay   i can feel ace right now  strategically wants to get rid  of me  the way that hes manipulating  matty hes a devil  and he has to go   this is this is awesome   getting this is just  incomparable   and the best part about this  is they dont get it   and they may be completely  out of rice to add insult to  injury   oh oh   what is this   oh my   oh my god   wait stop everyone shh   holy cow these are letters  from home   oh my god theyre letters  oh my god oh my god  gasps  oh my god  theyre really letters   sobbing   bob are you okay man   no im not   your family loves you bob   i know it sobbing  grunts  i dont know which one to read  first  this is from david   my dad he never writes  anything and he wrote me a  letter   isnt that cool   he never writes anything  he wasnt even excited  he didnt show any excitement  when i was leaving  wow   you should receive  i cant read it  my eyes keep blurring  im close to these people here  but these are the people that  are the closest to my heart  life is good  and i realize how lucky a man i  am  im here  and i cant  i cant wait to get home to  them  life doesnt get better than  this   back to the sugar shack  for me  i dont really know what the  hells happening in this game  im just  trying to survive laughs  thank god for ace  whats funny is im pretty sure  were using each other but i  feel like my tribe thinks im  naive and that im sticking  with him out of stupidity but  im sticking with him because  hes the strongest player at  this point  so i just hope that theyre not  all screwing me around   probst come on in guys  well now bring in sugar  returning from exile island   probst all right you guys  ready to get to todays  immunity challenge   yeah   probst first things first  dan i will take it back  thank you  good news and bad news about  todays challenge  bad news is both tribes are  going to tribal council tonight  both tribes are gonna vote  somebody out  the good news each of you will  have an equal shot at winning  individual immunity  its a log roll  youre gonna match up  against another tribe member  it might be somebody from the  other tribe  it might be somebody from your  own tribe  your goal is to stay on the log  longer than the other person  first person to hit the water  is out  winners move on  last person left standing wins  immunity and is safe at  tonights tribal council   i think i may have a target  on my back so its very very  important for me personally to  go in there and win and not  just win by a little  win by a lot   probst in addition there is  a twist which will be revealed  after the challenge is over   another twist   probst well draw numbers  get our matchups well get  started  all right first matchup dan  taking on ace  all right here we go  put a foot on the log  three two one walk  we are on first matchup  good footwork  dan is in the water  ace moves on to the next round  next round charlie versus  crystal  this challenge is on  charlie and crystal looking to  move on  crystal in the water first  charlie moving on to the next  round  big matchup marcus versus  matty  good save by marcus  mattys in the water  marcus moving on to the next  round  randy taking on susie  both from the kota tribe  nice footwork  ah susie in the water first  randy moving on to the next  round  kenny versus sugar  two fang members   this dumb thing laughs   i cant even move this   probst can he fight to hang  on  no kenny in the water first  sugar moving on  last of the first rounds bob  and corinne   of course he did  laughter   probst who knew that would  come in handy  here we go bob versus corinne  bob the former log roll winner  three two one walk  bob whistling sugar laughing  corinne in the water first  bob moving on  all right semifinal round  we have our matchups  charlie taking on ace  go   come on charlie   probst the winner moves on  to the final round  ace staying alive  charlies got him on the run  great match ace on the run  can he recover  charlies in the water first  ace moving on to the final  very close  now it is marcus taking on  randy  one of you will move on to the  final round   come on randy   probst randy on the run  randy in the water first  marcus moving on to the final  round  all right next round sugar  versus bob  were on  winner moves on to the final  round to join ace and marcus  great match  sugar not going anywhere  bob slips trying to hang on  bob is back up a great  recovery  sugar screams  bob in the water first  sugar moving on   congratulations   probst the log rolling  champion hits the water first  youll be ridiculed back home  laughter  for the final round all three  of you will be on the log at  the same time  groaning  take your spots  for the final round ace we  drew for spots you got the  middle  you guys put a foot on the log  hold it steady   you know i feel this win is  enormous so its important  that i win this challenge  if i can pull it off ill be  proud of myself  if not ill probably shoot  myself in the pinky toe   probst the challenge is on  three people on the log at once  the last person on the log wins  immunity  good footwork by all three  sugar with a nice save  another nice save by marcus  sugar on the run  another nice save  everybody still alive  sugar in the water first  its ace and marcus fighting  for immunity  great battle  ace in the water first  marcus wins individual immunity   whoo   probst congratulations  applause  marcus safe at tonights tribal  council  now to the twist this is yours  to read  read it out loud so everybody  can hear it   you will now assign immunity  to one member of the other  tribe  im going to give this to  sugar   probst sugar come on over  applause   my hope is that sugar is  smart enough to keep the  immunity idol to herself and  that might actually end up  giving us one of our biggest  surprises which would be  losing a big power player from  the fang tribe in ace matty  or crystal   probst sugar safe at  tonights tribal council for  fang  marcus is safe for kotas   when i saw sugar with the  immunity necklace around her  neck im like damn  this girl has two idols  she is now the most powerful  person in this game   who would you have picked  from the other tribe to give  immunity to   i dont know   you dont know   maybe susie   susie   yeah   yeah you think susies gonna  be gone tonight   i think thats irritating  people   oh  matty and ace theyre  thinking to get rid of crystal  and it all depends on the  pinup girl sugar  so yeah i will lie in this  game  i will do everything in my  power to get her to vote with  me because my life and crystals  life rests upon her  so basically this is honest  to god truth  this is whats happening around  camp  im not lying to you  matty goes were voting out  sugar next immunity challenge  and then crystals like okay  so then when crystal went away  i looked at ace im like  are we really voting out  sugar  and ace is like right now  sugar is really good for nothing  except for the hidden immunity  idol  they think youre like  clueless youre like a dumb  blonde or whatever  okay and ace thinks he has  you wrapped around his finger   okay  i dont trust kenny he might  have been lying to me  but i have been trusting the  biggest snake in the game so  far and ive known that  so i really dont know who to  trust at any point in this game   ace is like well i  actually got the hidden immunity  idol from her once i can  probably do that and then we can  blindside her and then ill have  the hidden immunity idol  and i was like oh my freaking  god this guy is a snake   you and i will say were  voting on crystal   we blindside ace   blindside ace today   and we dont have to worry  about the snake ever again   never again   i trust sugar and i trust  that she will go along with the  plan to vote out ace  she may be the pinup girl but  shes very smart   kenny has reassured me all is  well  i will truly believe sugar when  she writes aces name down  either shes going to write my  name or shes going to write  aces name   why  whos going to do that  theyd only have two votes  mattys with you   theyd have three votes   no itd be kenny and  crystal wouldnt it   i gave it back to you last  time  ill give it back to you this  time   oh ace i gotta think  about it okay   thats fine   you make me feel awful  when ace asked me for the idol  it made me think maybe kenny  was telling me the truth   dont you think after   ace definitely knows how to  finagle people much more than  ive ever seen anybody do  probably in my life  but hes definitely had my back   ill bring the last of it  and then thats it   all right go for it   crystals supposed to go  next but plans could change  ace could be turning on me now  i have no idea  oh god what am i gonna do with  this thing   probst sugar youve been  out here  days  tell me about camp life  whats going on   um we are very low on rice  crystal accidentally knocked  some over and she didnt eat  because she knocked it over   probst kenny how much rice  did you have before crystal  knocked it over   we had about seven days  worth  crystal ended up scooping some  of the rice that she spilled  outside back into the pot  so probably had about five and  a half days worth of rice   probst so matty the rice  is so valuable that if you  spill even a little in the dirt  you gotta pick it out grain by  grain   the rice is valuable  its the most valuable thing we  have  we get about six to eight  spoonfuls a day of rice   probst wow   and she spills the rice and  nobody goes god crystal  what are you doing nobody   no but your faces said it  all   just simmer down   your face said it all   my face says it all nobody  says a word to her   because they knew it was an  accident   exactly so just   i didnt purposely go over to  the rice box and just throw the  rice down   just let me get to my point  can i get to my point   get to your point and then  ill talk   so then we looked past it  we moved past that issue   probst ace make sense of  that for me   crystal made a mistake  thats common  the whole part of us feeling  angry at her i thought was a bit  concocted in her own head   now im delusional  i can see it on your face ace  okay dont look at me like  that  when matty turned around he was  like oh whatever  then he made some look at you  ace  i didnt say anything to  anybody  i just sat down there picking up  about  grains of rice  and then they started to eat  oh crystal come on and eat  no i spilled some of the rice  so i will go without and  thats what i did and thats  why i did it   nobody asked you to crystal   its not like you saved me  any anyways you still ate it   i asked you three times   yeah i mean if you cared  enough you wouldve saved me  some anyways   probst sugar you have  like the perfect seat in the  midst of this great  shakespearean drama   i know   probst your eyes are like  saucers   this sounds like such petty  bull crap to me  i mean i think that we can get  past our issues better than  this and this is why we havent  been winning because people are  holding these stupid petty  things against each other   probst all right sugar you  have individual immunity  tonight  you can assign that to somebody  else or keep it for yourself   keeping it   probst sugar is safe  tonight  everybody else is fair game  it is time to vote  ace youre up   youre one of the snakes and  i got to get rid of you  go home   crystal ive been waiting  for this day for so long and i  am so happy its here   probst ill go tally the  votes  if anybody has the hidden  immunity idol and you want to  play it now would be the time  to do so  okay once the votes are read  the decision is final  the person voted out will be  asked to leave the tribal  council area immediately  ill read the votes  first vote ace  crystal  one vote ace one vote crystal  ace  two votes ace one vote crystal  were tied  two votes crystal two votes  ace one vote left  seventh person voted out of  isurvivor gaboni  ace thats three  you need to bring me your torch   probst ace the tribe has  spoken   good luck guys   probst well based on the  reaction from ace id say that  was a blindside   days in fang is finally  starting to play this game  grab your torches  head back to camp  good night  dont go away  coming up next kota prepares  for their own tribal council   right now would be an  optimal time to get me out   probst while dan digs his  own grave  susie commits social suicide   i was actually going to vote  you   really  i hate her  i want her gone yesterday   can i ask you a question   what   im not going tonight am i   not that i know of  given the fact that everyones  voting for susie   it has to be susie cause  we have no idea  we could stay together as a  tribe for another two rounds  right now would be an optimal  time to get me out as a strong  player so this is a huge vote  for me because im either going  to come back here and trust  everyone or im going to be at  home eating a pizza   please trust us   yeah   and you know   andand that is incredible  faith on my part but i know i  got to do it   randys replaced bob in a  final four situation because i  think randys willing to cast  his lot in with a good group of  people and hes found that  and he you know as long as he  keeps his end of the bargain  hes got a great run for this  game   she knows shes low man on  the totem pole  shes bound to  she may continue to dig her  grave all day long andand  yalls conclusion may shift   of course   as annoying as bob is i see  him as being as loyal and  trustworthy as the day is long   andand right now i cant  say the same thing about dan   i cant either   but im closer being able to  say it about susie than i am  about dan   dan is super vulnerable  tonight  and the only thing dan has going  for him right now is that he  should really cross his fingers  that susies going to blow up  and do some crazy stuff   i really like you and i  dont want you to go home  so im not writing your name  down and i just wanted you to  know that  youre just not on my list of   do you know whowho theyre  thinking about voting out   um i think that its going  to be dan   thats what your your guess  is its gonna be dan   i think so yeah  but we felt like we dont want  to take somebody thats gonna  flip  i feel really good about the  fact that you wouldnt   no i wouldnt as long as  you keep me in the loop  ii figured people were talking  and i figured eventually they  would come to me and tell me  where im at you know  cause i when i was gonna  okay im gonna be honest with  you  i was actually going to vote  you because   why   because i know that im a  hard worker  ii know that without having  fire and water and food how are  you going to perform physically  youre going to have to take  that time to do that work   mmhmm   so im just being totally up  front with you so and  thats the truth   okay so you need me to help  more   well yeah i need help from  everybody actually  so thats where im at  but ii appreciate that cause  now i know which way i can  swing   so this moron has decided  that shed like me to go  really  i hate her  i hate her hate her hate her  like i really want to stab her  in the face  and if you piss me off youve  pissed off my alliance   did i not say to you guys  shes nuts  i mean certifiable   but shes the worst kind of  nuts cause you dont see it  coming   she goes whichever way the  wind is blowing   um i mean i hate her  i want her gone yesterday   susies game is no game  and the problem with no game is  her vote can be bought  shes gone   tonight i dont want any  sort of curveball  i do not want to go home  tonight  i dont know what could be  cooking  i mean dan doesnt have the  idol does he   not that i know of   what if susie and dan get  together dan has the idol  and hes like lets both  vote corinne   then youre gone   lets just take her out  then she has to go   everybodys ass is on the  line  susie needs to go  shes annoying  i want her to go home and soon   so um heres the thing  my entire plan was wedged on the  fact that susie is easy she  trusts us and shes never  gonna win individual immunity  we can get rid of her when we  want  i didnt realize she wasi locoi  ien la cabezai  like i had no idea that that  was what i was dealing with   i am devastated right now   well im completely  frustrated because i feel like  we got some issues that we had  no idea existed   what do you think is the  safer bet  cause im really a little  concerned   were at the point where  i think either decision has  incredible risks associated  with it   right   thank god we have a  twoperson advantage at this  point  but dan could have the  immunity idol  but i really doubt it so  if he actually does have the  immunity idol we should vote  out susie   yeah   just in case theres an idol   yeah  were worried that dan has the  immunity idol because he spent  a couple days on exile island  but we also think that dan may  need to go  so unfortunately its not who  is the best asset  its who is the least risky  which stinks because you know  we still dont know who were  gonna be better off with   probst marcus is the game  at a point where youre now  looking out for yourself versus  keeping our tribe strong   i think were basing our  decision on what were  expecting to come in the next  few days  weve got to surround ourselves  with the most powerful crowd of  people because thats the only  way were going to survive an  onslaught from the rest of the  fang tribe   probst susie looking at  this tribe you got to be a  little concerned yourself  is it fair to say that youre  the weakest person on this  tribe in challenges   ii dont think i am  i think theres certain skills  that i may be a little bit  weaker at but   probst whos weaker than  you on this tribe   um i think strengthwise  upper strength i think im  stronger than corinne   probst corinne not buying  that at all   i dont want to insult her  i think that she is very  skilled and i think that she  does have athletic talent you  know   probst she just insulted  you   well yes and thats why im  telling you that i dont agree  i think that i have a lot to  offer  i think i have upper body  strength  i think ive got a lot of  things but   and you probably do  i dont i mean im just im  trying to just kind of observe  and just kind of see where this  games taking me and   probst corinne have you  picked up on susies tendencies  to maybe sometimes let loose   yeah but ive operated  without a filter for so many  years that like i totally  respect when people come out of  their shell and just say  whatever it is that theyre  thinking  i mean i would encourage more  of that  maybe you should blow up once  in a while and then ill know  you better   probst randy where do you  sit on the be yourself versus  hold it in   im probably about eight on a  scale of ten and thats good  and bad   probst whats good about it   i dont have to pretend  and uh you know people pretty  much know where i stand most of  the time   probst whats bad about it   i dont have to pretend and  people know where i stand most  of the time  laughter   probst dan where do you fit  in on that   um i tend to be a  worrywart and so it has  inhibited me from being  completely comfortable and  completely myself  but my result in the game will  fare much better if i can shake  it off and just relax   probst charlie how big a  factor is trust becoming   days in for this group of  seven   its huge because we intend  to go into a merge as a  powerful group together  and if someone splinters our  numbers will dwindle before the  fang numbers dwindle  so my vote is based on who i can  trust going into a merge most   probst corinne is it  possible that tonights vote  could be a mistake   damn yeah  i dont know if were making  the right decision or if i  personally am making the right  decision  i hope that i am   probst all right lets get  to the vote  marcus thanks to a nice  performance today you have  individual immunity  it is yours unless you choose  to give it to somebody else   we won it for kota but im  going to hang on to this one   probst all right you cannot  vote for marcus  everybody else is fair game  it is time to vote  bob youre up   dan  sorry guy   susie you have a uh a  great heart and im going to  vote with what i think the rest  of the tribe is voting   this is about dan not you   probst ill go tally the  votes  if anybody has the hidden  immunity idol and you want to  play it now would be the time  to do so  okay once the votes are read  the decision is final  person voted out will be  asked to leave the tribal  council area immediately  ill read the votes  first vote susie  dan  dan  two votes dan one vote susie  susie  were tied two votes susie  two votes dan  dan  three votes dan two votes  susie  susie  were tied three votes susie  three votes dan  one vote left  eighth person voted out of  isurvivor gaboni  dan  need to bring me your torch  dan the tribe has spoken  its time for you to go   thanks jeff   probst well despite being  very successful this is not  one big happy family  grab your torches head back to  camp  good night  captioning sponsored by  cbs  captioned by  media access group at wgbh  accesswgbhorg  stay tuned for scenes from

know how we told you that your white blood cell are confused and theyre attacking your own body this should help uh calm them down im sorry it just the last few hour have just been so scary and no one seems to know whats causing this well hlh is an aggressive syndrome but it caused by an underlying condition that most people dont even know they have so the real question is whats underneath this how do we find out i get to know a much about you a i possibly can have you had covid that can be a trigger sometimes mm no not that i know of and where do you live what do you do for work um my son and i live in queen but we came from ukraine last year you got out after the russian bombed a school in our village i took dimi and we fled mustve been horrible we hid in farm stable stowed away in train car but we made it out we left our home behind and i vowed to give my son a better life here but a new country no family it been lonely and now this illness it mm whats wrong um what are you doing well im very sorry but i think i made a mistake this is not gonna help you hey brucellosis brucellosis thats yulia salenkos underlying condition howd you land there because when she fled the war in ukraine with her son they were hiding out in farm and stable it it livestock thats gotta be how she got it so in order to treat her hlh we have to completely rid her body of all trace of brucellosis yeah i already started her on a massive regimen of antibiotic all right so if she fled ukraine when the war began thats a year ago i mean the bacteria would have spread to every part of her body yeah thats untreated endocarditis i didnt say it wa gonna be easy max floyd if we dont at least try then she will have come all this way just to die here and her son is gonna be orphaned in a foreign country i hear you i do but what youre talking about this procedure it will literally take dozen of highly trained surgeon and specialist to pull it off by my count it gonna take you know damn well that money wa for courtneys brace and if my garage go under then what your garage is struggling because you ran it into the damn ground you know im doing whats best for this family no youre doing whats best for horace like always you never respect me im the man of this house then act like one floyd what did you do baby i put it back together for you clamp scalpel forceps popcorn on a stick

got no wiggle room over here floyd try over there oh god oh we just lost the bypass machine our patient just died but hey this is why we rehearse right max were packed in here so tight that if i just breathe im gonna knock something over i know we can rework the plan we can do some of the surgery individually instead of simultaneously anything thats gonna give u more space to work in here but it gonna add time that we cant afford i can help how i can replace the aortic valve while her heart still beating then we can get rid of this bypass machine so it doesnt take up so much space will that save time yes while her heart still beating have you ever done that before no okay you better start practicing all right what do you think stripe outrageous pattern which one neither what no tie huh what about a bolo albert wore a turquoise one on our first date and i found it quite fetching oh yes albert the new beau when do i get to meet the lucky fella huh what do you think dinner saturday night uh okay good we can chat about his affinity for southwestern apparel what are you doing oh im uh im ignoring him yeah i can see that mmhmm but why well because with selective mutism you do not

theyre not all screwing me around probst come on in guy well now bring in sugar returning from exile island probst all right you guy ready to get to today immunity challenge yeah probst first thing first dan i will take it back thank you good news and bad news about today challenge bad news is both tribe are going to tribal council tonight both tribe are gonna vote somebody out the good news each of you will have an equal shot at winning individual immunity it a log roll youre gonna match up against another tribe member it might be somebody from the other tribe it might be somebody from your own tribe your goal is to stay on the log longer than the other person first person to hit the water is out winner move on last person left standing win immunity and is safe at tonight tribal council i think i may have a target on my back so it very very important for me personally to go in there and win and not just win by a little win by a lot probst in addition there is a twist which will be revealed after the challenge is over another twist probst well draw number get our matchup well get started all right first matchup dan taking on ace all right here we go put a foot on the log three two one walk we are on first matchup good footwork dan is in the water ace move on to the next round next round charlie versus crystal this challenge is on charlie and crystal looking to move on crystal in the water first charlie moving on to the next round big matchup marcus versus matty good save by marcus mattys in the water marcus moving on to the next round randy taking on susie both from the kota tribe nice footwork ah susie in the water first randy moving on to the next round kenny versus sugar two fang member this dumb thing laugh i cant even move this probst can he fight to hang on no kenny in the water first sugar moving on last of the first round bob and corinne of course he did laughter probst who knew that would come in handy here we go bob versus corinne bob the former log roll winner three two one walk bob whistling sugar laughing corinne in the water first bob moving on all right semifinal round we have our matchup charlie taking on ace go come on charlie probst the winner move on to the final round ace staying alive charlies got him on the run great match ace on the run can he recover charlies in the water first ace moving on to the final very close now it is marcus taking on randy one of you will move on to the final round come on randy probst randy on the run randy in the water first marcus moving on to the final round all right next round sugar versus bob were on winner move on to the final round to join ace and marcus great match sugar not going anywhere bob slip trying to hang on bob is back up a great recovery sugar scream bob in the water first sugar moving on congratulation probst the log rolling champion hit the water first youll be ridiculed back home laughter for the final round all three of you will be on the log at the same time groaning take your spot for the final round ace we drew for spot you got the middle you guy put a foot on the log hold it steady you know i feel this win is enormous so it important that i win this challenge if i can pull it off ill be proud of myself if not ill probably shoot myself in the pinky toe probst the challenge is on three people on the log at once the last person on the log win immunity good footwork by all three sugar with a nice save another nice save by marcus sugar on the run another nice save everybody still alive sugar in the water first it ace and marcus fighting for immunity great battle ace in the water first marcus win individual immunity whoo probst congratulation applause marcus safe at tonight tribal council now to the twist this is yours to read read it out loud so everybody can hear it you will now assign immunity to one member of the other tribe im going to give this to sugar probst sugar come on over applause my hope is that sugar is smart enough to keep the immunity idol to herself and that might actually end up giving u one of our biggest surprise which would be losing a big power player from the fang tribe in ace matty or crystal probst sugar safe at tonight tribal council for fang marcus is safe for kota when i saw sugar with the immunity necklace around her neck im like damn this girl ha two idol she is now the most powerful person in this game who would you have picked from the other tribe to give immunity to i dont know you dont know maybe susie susie yeah yeah you think susies gonna be gone tonight i think thats irritating people oh matty and ace theyre thinking to get rid of crystal and it all depends on the pinup girl sugar so yeah i will lie in this game i will do everything in my power to get her to vote with me because my life and crystal life rest upon her so basically this is honest to god truth this is whats happening around camp im not lying to you matty go were voting out sugar next immunity challenge and then crystal like okay so then when crystal went away i looked at ace im like are we really voting out sugar and ace is like right now sugar is really good for nothing except for the hidden immunity idol they think youre like clueless youre like a dumb blonde or whatever okay and ace think he ha you wrapped around his finger okay i dont trust kenny he might have been lying to me but i have been trusting the biggest snake in the game so far and ive known that so i really dont know who to trust at any point in this game ace is like well i actually got the hidden immunity idol from her once i can probably do that and then we can blindside her and then ill have the hidden immunity idol and i wa like oh my freaking god this guy is a snake you and i will say were voting on crystal we blindside ace blindside ace today and we dont have to worry about the snake ever again never again i trust sugar and i trust that she will go along with the plan to vote out ace she may be the pinup girl but shes very smart kenny ha reassured me all is well i will truly believe sugar when she writes ace name down either shes going to write my name or shes going to write ace name why who going to do that theyd only have two vote mattys with you theyd have three vote no itd be kenny and crystal wouldnt it i gave it back to you last time ill give it back to you this time oh ace i gotta think about it okay thats fine you make me feel awful when ace asked me for the idol it made me think maybe kenny wa telling me the truth dont you think after ace definitely know how to finagle people much more than ive ever seen anybody do probably in my life but he definitely had my back ill bring the last of it and then thats it all right go for it crystal supposed to go next but plan could change ace could be turning on me now i have no idea oh god what am i gonna do with this thing probst sugar youve been out here day tell me about camp life whats going on um we are very low on rice crystal accidentally knocked some over and she didnt eat because she knocked it over probst kenny how much rice did you have before crystal knocked it over we had about seven day worth crystal ended up scooping some of the rice that she spilled outside back into the pot so probably had about five and a half day worth of rice probst so matty the rice is so valuable that if you spill even a little in the dirt you gotta pick it out grain by grain the rice is valuable it the most valuable thing we have we get about six to eight spoonful a day of rice probst wow and she spill the rice and nobody go god crystal what are you doing nobody no but your face said it all just simmer down your face said it all my face say it all nobody say a word to her because they knew it wa an accident exactly so just i didnt purposely go over to the rice box and just throw the rice down just let me get to my point can i get to my point get to your point and then ill talk so then we looked past it we moved past that issue probst ace make sense of that for me crystal made a mistake thats common the whole part of u feeling angry at her i thought wa a bit concocted in her own head now im delusional i can see it on your face ace okay dont look at me like that when matty turned around he wa like oh whatever then he made some look at you ace i didnt say anything to anybody i just sat down there picking up about grain of rice and then they started to eat oh crystal come on and eat no i spilled some of the rice so i will go without and thats what i did and thats why i did it nobody asked you to crystal it not like you saved me any anyways you still ate it i asked you three time yeah i mean if you cared enough you wouldve saved me some anyways probst sugar you have like the perfect seat in the midst of this great shakespearean drama i know probst your eye are like saucer this sound like such petty bull crap to me i mean i think that we can get past our issue better than this and this is why we havent been winning because people are holding these stupid petty thing against each other probst all right sugar you have individual immunity tonight you can assign that to somebody else or keep it for yourself keeping it probst sugar is safe tonight everybody else is fair game it is time to vote ace youre up youre one of the snake and i got to get rid of you go home crystal ive been waiting for this day for so long and i am so happy it here probst ill go tally the vote if anybody ha the hidden immunity idol and you want to play it now would be the time to do so okay once the vote are read the decision is final the person voted out will be asked to leave the tribal council area immediately ill read the vote first vote ace crystal one vote ace one vote crystal ace two vote ace one vote crystal were tied two vote crystal two vote ace one vote left seventh person voted out of isurvivor gaboni ace thats three you need to bring me your torch probst ace the tribe ha spoken good luck guy probst well based on the reaction from ace id say that wa a blindside day in fang is finally starting to play this game grab your torch head back to camp good night dont go away coming up next kota prepares for their own tribal council right now would be an optimal time to get me out probst while dan dig his own grave susie commits social suicide i wa actually going to vote you really i hate her i want her gone yesterday can i ask you a question what im not going tonight am i not that i know of given the fact that everyones voting for susie it ha to be susie cause we have no idea we could stay together a a tribe for another two round right now would be an optimal time to get me out a a strong player so this is a huge vote for me because im either going to come back here and trust everyone or im going to be at home eating a pizza please trust u yeah and you know andand that is incredible faith on my part but i know i got to do it randys replaced bob in a final four situation because i think randys willing to cast his lot in with a good group of people and he found that and he you know a long a he keep his end of the bargain he got a great run for this game she know shes low man on the totem pole shes bound to she may continue to dig her grave all day long andand yalls conclusion may shift of course a annoying a bob is i see him a being a loyal and trustworthy a the day is long andand right now i cant say the same thing about dan i cant either but im closer being able to say it about susie than i am about dan dan is super vulnerable tonight and the only thing dan ha going for him right now is that he should really cross his finger that susies going to blow up and do some crazy stuff i really like you and i dont want you to go home so im not writing your name down and i just wanted you to know that youre just not on my list of do you know whowho theyre thinking about voting out um i think that it going to be dan thats what your your guess is it gonna be dan i think so yeah but we felt like we dont want to take somebody thats gonna flip i feel really good about the fact that you wouldnt no i wouldnt a long a you keep me in the loop ii figured people were talking and i figured eventually they would come to me and tell me where im at you know cause i when i wa gonna okay im gonna be honest with you i wa actually going to vote you because why because i know that im a hard worker ii know that without having fire and water and food how are you going to perform physically youre going to have to take that time to do that work mmhmm so im just being totally up front with you so and thats the truth okay so you need me to help more well yeah i need help from everybody actually so thats where im at but ii appreciate that cause now i know which way i can swing so this moron ha decided that shed like me to go really i hate her i hate her hate her hate her like i really want to stab her in the face and if you piss me off youve pissed off my alliance did i not say to you guy shes nut i mean certifiable but shes the worst kind of nut cause you dont see it coming she go whichever way the wind is blowing um i mean i hate her i want her gone yesterday susies game is no game and the problem with no game is her vote can be bought shes gone tonight i dont want any sort of curveball i do not want to go home tonight i dont know what could be cooking i mean dan doesnt have the idol doe he not that i know of what if susie and dan get together dan ha the idol and he like let both vote corinne then youre gone let just take her out then she ha to go everybodys as is on the line susie need to go shes annoying i want her to go home and soon so um here the thing my entire plan wa wedged on the fact that susie is easy she trust u and shes never gonna win individual immunity we can get rid of her when we want i didnt realize she wasi locoi ien la cabezai like i had no idea that that wa what i wa dealing with i am devastated right now well im completely frustrated because i feel like we got some issue that we had no idea existed what do you think is the safer bet cause im really a little concerned were at the point where i think either decision ha incredible risk associated with it right thank god we have a twoperson advantage at this point but dan could have the immunity idol but i really doubt it so if he actually doe have the immunity idol we should vote out susie yeah just in case there an idol yeah were worried that dan ha the immunity idol because he spent a couple day on exile island but we also think that dan may need to go so unfortunately it not who is the best asset it who is the least risky which stink because you know we still dont know who were gonna be better off with probst marcus is the game at a point where youre now looking out for yourself versus keeping our tribe strong i think were basing our decision on what were expecting to come in the next few day weve got to surround ourselves with the most powerful crowd of people because thats the only way were going to survive an onslaught from the rest of the fang tribe probst susie looking at this tribe you got to be a little concerned yourself is it fair to say that youre the weakest person on this tribe in challenge ii dont think i am i think there certain skill that i may be a little bit weaker at but probst who weaker than you on this tribe um i think strengthwise upper strength i think im stronger than corinne probst corinne not buying that at all i dont want to insult her i think that she is very skilled and i think that she doe have athletic talent you know probst she just insulted you well yes and thats why im telling you that i dont agree i think that i have a lot to offer i think i have upper body strength i think ive got a lot of thing but and you probably do i dont i mean im just im trying to just kind of observe and just kind of see where this game taking me and probst corinne have you picked up on susies tendency to maybe sometimes let loose yeah but ive operated without a filter for so many year that like i totally respect when people come out of their shell and just say whatever it is that theyre thinking i mean i would encourage more of that maybe you should blow up once in a while and then ill know you better probst randy where do you sit on the be yourself versus hold it in im probably about eight on a scale of ten and thats good and bad probst whats good about it i dont have to pretend and uh you know people pretty much know where i stand most of the time probst whats bad about it i dont have to pretend and people know where i stand most of the time laughter probst dan where do you fit in on that um i tend to be a worrywart and so it ha inhibited me from being completely comfortable and completely myself but my result in the game will fare much better if i can shake it off and just relax probst charlie how big a factor is trust becoming day in for this group of seven it huge because we intend to go into a merge a a powerful group together and if someone splinter our number will dwindle before the fang number dwindle so my vote is based on who i can trust going into a merge most probst corinne is it possible that tonight vote could be a mistake damn yeah i dont know if were making the right decision or if i personally am making the right decision i hope that i am probst all right let get to the vote marcus thanks to a nice performance today you have individual immunity it is yours unless you choose to give it to somebody else we won it for kota but im going to hang on to this one probst all right you cannot vote for marcus everybody else is fair game it is time to vote bob youre up dan sorry guy susie you have a uh a great heart and im going to vote with what i think the rest of the tribe is voting this is about dan not you probst ill go tally the vote if anybody ha the hidden immunity idol and you want to play it now would be the time to do so okay once the vote are read the decision is final person voted out will be asked to leave the tribal council area immediately ill read the vote first vote susie dan dan two vote dan one vote susie susie were tied two vote susie two vote dan dan three vote dan two vote susie susie were tied three vote susie three vote dan one vote left eighth person voted out of isurvivor gaboni dan need to bring me your torch dan the tribe ha spoken it time for you to go thanks jeff probst well despite being very successful this is not one big happy family grab your torch head back to camp good night

that wa what i wa dealing with i am devastated right now ', ' what i wa dealing with i am devastated right now well im completely frustrated because i feel like we got some issue that we had no idea existed what do you think is the safer bet cause im really a little concerned were at the point where i think either decision ha incredible risk associated with it right thank god we have a twoperson advantage at this point but dan could have the immunity idol but i really doubt it so if he actually doe have the immunity idol we should vote out susie yeah just', 'e immunity idol we should vote out susie yeah just in case there an idol yeah were worried that dan ha the immunity idol because he spent a couple day on exile island but we also think that dan may need to go so unfortunately it not
