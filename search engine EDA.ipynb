george weve gotta know  if theres any real basis for an investigation  well i ill have to think that  ill have to think about that  daley what is there to think about  i dont see how the division can

job  thats fair enough  well be in touch  chattering  inspector palmer can i see you a minute  was it necessary to let everyone in the station know i was coming here to see these guys  you believe that a fullscale investigation is warranted  daley yes commissioner delaney  go to it  but sir  shouldnt headquarters handle something like this  no  youre all experienced men  chief gallagher here

questions  yes yes mrs crist  if i may mr knowles thank you  officer serpico came to the th division  more than a year and a half ago  all during that time the things hes told us were taking place

the present inquiry  id like to answer that question sir  officer serpico cannot be considered derelict of his duty in any way  or guilty of any infraction of the law quite the contrary  the district attorney is not prepared to say any more at this time  very well mr tauber officer serpico thank you for your testimony  this hearing is adjourned until  tomorrow morning  why didnt you tell them about delaney kellogg  frank this was a grand jury about police officers actively engaged in corruption  you dont implicate people without sufficient evidence  now thats crap and you know it  even a dumb cop like me knows a prosecutor can take a grand jury  anywhere it wants to take it  you never led me anywhere near the real problems  nothing about the bosses the brass  how corruption like this

you expecting an army  no just a division  tauber did you know ive had reports about serpico being a fag  he used to hang out in the bcl washroom  thats stupid commissioner and you know it  you know mr commissioner a gold shield for serpico at this time  would convince a lot of people not while im commissioner  commanders office  its down that corridor  hey serpico do you know what theyre saying

this the pickups are made by  retired policemen  that way no plainclothes men are directly involved  now we need investigative help on this one chief  well inspector if you need investigative help  and you dont trust your own men  why dont you requisition some recruits from the police academy  with all due respect sir  backing us up is the only hope that the police department has got  there are good cops whod come forward  if there was any encouragement in the department to do so  and if they thought it would do any good if not they wont do it  ive done a whole lot more than most people to defend and preserve  the image of this department and protect commissioner delaney  against reckless and irresponsible assaults from outside agencies  thats it huh  i mean thats whats really important isnt it  thats what you wanna know  what outside agencies ive been to right  phone rings  blair hello hello prick  who is this frank  frank how are you where are you  im ready to go to the times  its

lindsay announced the formation of a special committee  to review the city procedures for investigating police corruption  how come im not in the first paragraph  unbelievable  yeehoo  the times report smells of the familiar smear tactics of mccarthyism  this government must and will root out corruption  with every means at our command  the mayor has this day appointed a special investigation commission  knocking  to be headed by whitman knapp yeah come  heres your reward frank  its a transfer to narcotics brooklyn south  still in clothes you get a tin shield you dont get a gold one  i miss you already frank  look  frank  its narcotics  you be careful  its very easy to get hurt  and to  to be set up  gunshot  serpico  get in  youre not wired are you  okay you cocksucker  you might get by in the bronx with that kind of shit  but down here  a month is chicken feed  last week one dope dealer sent out these guys making pickups  forty thousand each  we let them collect it all and then hit them  a hundred and twenty thousand split four ways  thats serious money  and with that you dont fuck around  i got the message  good now get the fuck out  the guys name is limbo he just uses

you shopping uhhuh  dogs barking  man limbo  gerardo  speaking quietly in spanish  heinemann police freeze  police officer all right  to the wall against the wall  goddamn it get up  all right palms

doctor thank you  stay out of there didnt they tell you  what  the word is dont talk to him hes no fucking good  how you doing kid serpico thickly hello sid  how are you  wanna read my fan mail  sure  youre a big shot now huh  sid  i want you to get those fucking cops away from my door  the knapp commission likes you they want you to appear  well naturally  frank heinemann and julio are cleared  the three of you are up for exceptional merit awards  thats very funny  its very funny  francesco you love me  i always had a thing for you sid you know that  your gold shields come through  clicks tongue  chuckles  whats this for  for being an honest cop  hm  or for being stupid enough to get shot in the face  you tell them they can shove it  i dont want it  oh well  mumbles  well frank the facts are these  youll have to stay on leave of absence for a few months  in all probability the hearing in your left ear wont come back  two bullet fragments are still lodged in the bony portion  one is very close to the carotid artery  and youll have to be checked from time to time  your left side will feel stiff occasionally  once in a great while you may experience some dizziness  but in general youll be okay    through my appearance here today  i hope that police officers in the future  will not experience the same frustration and anxiety  that i was subjected to for the past five years  at the hands of my superiors  because of my attempt to report corruption  i was made to feel that i had burdened them  with an unwanted task  the problem is that the atmosphere does not yet exist  in which an honest police officer  can act without fear of ridicule or reprisal from fellow officers  police corruption cannot exist  unless it is at least tolerated at higher levels in the department  therefore the most important result that can come from these hearings  is a conviction by police officers that the department will change  in order to ensure this  an independent permanent investigative body  dealing with police corruption like this commission is essential  audience applauding    subtitles by sdi media group  watch any video online with opensubtitles free browser

it definitely upset him yeah   didnt put him in a happy place  horner yeah  verstappen it was not a great moment for the team  there was definitely a chance for second  but of course there was a red flag with checo having a moment  once somebody hits the barrier thats it you know  it is annoying but what can you do  horner i think he just got too greedy  he made a mistake  you know this is gonna be a tough one tomorrow  indistinct chatter  its cool never saw anyone win a race on a saturday  yeah  see you later frustrating  overlapping chatter  photographers charles  charles straight ahead charles straight ahead  reporter it sometimes happens in monaco its a bit of an anticlimax  but this time one of your drivers  has potentially cost the other one a shot at pole  horner its a shame

he was struggling huh  well not all qualifying all day  marko all day  and now we have to hope for rain  horner yeah  buxton with ferrari starting first and second on the grid  its gonna be very difficult to beat them  this is a tight twisting narrow circuit  where overtaking is almost impossible  this race could represent the point of the season  where that balance of championship power shifts back from red bull to ferrari  dramatic stinger   horner its definitely getting darker  team member oh god yeah  commentator  iwith clouds above tension is building upi  ifor the start of the

gonna be tough  in formula  there is so much pressure for us to deliver  we need to work as a team  the only chance we have to beat ferrari is as a team  and that means you know we need our drivers to

and  these people have got my back   probst throughout the game  the red tribe fang  consistently made questionable  moves   im stuck in a tribe that has  no skills   probst ace made a headsup  play   thats the deal   deal   deal   probst when he pulled  matty into an alliance with his  longtime ally sugar   ive been relying on ace the  whole time   one of sugars biggest  plusses is the fact that she has  the immunity idol  and ive got sugar in my pocket   probst their first move was  to vote out aces biggest enemy  kelly  kelly the tribe has spoken   are left  who will be voted out tonight     animals chirping chittering  animal squawks in distance   this is a tough game  were starving   theres nothing to eat  im starting to lose my spirit  im starting to lose my hope  itsits become hopeless  im hopeless about fang   what happened   as soon as i got up it  tipped over  but just a little bit came out  but ill scoop it back in there  cause it it was just a  little bit   thats a ton  rice is more valuable than gold  and she just clumsily trips over  it and spills it  i wanted to just lay into her  and chew her out but i its  just pointless  you cant cry over spilled  milk you know  its just too late  is it done   yeah not so bad   you guys ready   nothing like some fresh  oatmeal rice   i dont want to take away  from you and matty   crystal eat   ace you eat   come on

like  makes me feel bad a little bit  thats just me like thats how  i am with groups   yeah yeah   you know i like to be part  of the group   i would say that dan is  socially inept in a lot of ways  i dont know if hes a former  fatty or why he wasnt liked as  a child but deep down inside  hes a little kid thats seeking  approval   its different than fang  where i alienated myself because  i didnt like those people  with you guys its completely  opposite  its like all right i really  like these three   dan is the ultimate paranoid  human being  at some point dan is gonna be a  huge liability and  unfortunately theres nothing i  can do toto sort of save him  fromfrom himself at this point   do you feel better   yeah i do   okay   do you guys   yeah   all right good      probst come on in

yeah im here to break  records you know laughs   probst all right sugar get  your stuff   sugar is a pinup model  she is completely worthless when  it comes to challenges  so when it comes to sugar in  this game i would really  really really desire her to go   probst kota it should be a  fun afternoon  indistinct chatter  fang i got nothing for you   we lost the biggest reward  yet  its hard you know when you  see them walking away  they have everything and we  have nothing  and we see kota in their  beautiful chopper just lavishing  in their reward you know  its madness its total  madness      reward was a helicopter ride  and i was lucky enough to have  ithei frontrow seat  just seeing that incredible  crater it made my trip to  africa  the only thing that was beating  faster than the rotors on that  helicopter was the beating of my  heart   oh wow   close as i want to get   holy cow   stay away from the edge   youre making me nervous  marcus  the beautiful scenery it was  awesome  its something i thought i would  never experience so it just  gives you more incentive more  power more strength to know  that you can get through this  no matter what  so it was very it was very  surreal for me  it was just amazing   lets get our blanket out   this is great lets get our  blanket out   sardines haha   i dont think in  my entire  years of living  ive ever been so embarrassed  im humiliated i felt pathetic  my spirits are dropping so fast  i look over and like sugar  shes just she cant do  anything  shes just being dominated  it was pointless for us to even  keep going  she was just standing there  getting walked all over  i hate it  im starting to get pissed  as long as theres physical  challenges were gonna lose  want to take a boat ride ace   sure bro   we need to take out sugar  okay this is what we do  we go kenny crystal and i vote  for sugar  you dont have to vote for  sugar so youre not  backstabbing her okay  sugars gone and its you and i  to the merge a hundred percent  theres no question   you know were a hundred  percent you and me   no i dont know that  were aligned  me and you are aligned so make  me comfortable  we need to take out sugar or at  least get the idol out   yeah i see the logic dude  i see that logic   okay we know exactly where  its sitting and we can use it  to our advantage when we have  to   you know what theyre  talking about right cri   yeah those two asses out  there in the boat trying to get  me off   they are will you trust me   ive been there with you  from day one kenny   we have to blindside ace   yeah   i have to talk to sugar  crystal you trust me a  hundred percent right   i trust you a hundred  percent   okay   i can feel ace right now  strategically wants to get rid  of me  the way that hes manipulating  matty hes a devil  and he has to go   this is this is awesome   getting this is just  incomparable   and the best part about this  is they dont get it   and they may be completely  out of rice to add insult to  injury   oh oh   what is this   oh my   oh my god   wait stop everyone shh   holy cow these are letters  from home   oh my god theyre letters  oh my god oh my god  gasps  oh

cant wait to get home to  them  life doesnt get better than  this   back to the sugar shack  for me  i dont really know what the  hells happening in this game  im just  trying to survive laughs  thank god for ace  whats funny is im pretty sure  were using each other but i  feel like my tribe thinks im  naive and that im sticking  with him out of stupidity but  im sticking with him because  hes the strongest player at  this point  so i just hope that theyre not  all screwing me around   probst come on in guys  well now bring in sugar  returning from exile island   probst all right you guys  ready to get to todays  immunity challenge   yeah   probst first things first  dan i will take it back  thank you  good news and bad news about  todays challenge  bad news is both tribes are  going to tribal council tonight  both tribes are gonna vote  somebody out  the good news each of you will  have an equal shot at winning  individual immunity  its a log roll  youre gonna match up  against another tribe member  it might be somebody from the  other tribe  it might be somebody from your  own tribe  your goal is to stay on the log  longer than the other person  first person to hit the water  is out  winners move on  last person left standing wins  immunity and is safe at  tonights tribal council   i think i may have a target  on my back so its very very  important for me personally to  go in there and win and not  just win by a little  win by a lot   probst in addition there is  a twist which will be revealed  after the challenge is over   another twist   probst well draw numbers  get our matchups well get  started  all right first matchup dan  taking on ace  all right here we go  put a foot on the log  three two one walk  we are on first matchup  good footwork  dan is

probst the winner moves on  to the final round  ace staying alive  charlies got him on the run  great match ace on the run  can he recover  charlies in the water first  ace moving on to the final  very close  now it is marcus taking on  randy  one of you will move on to the  final round   come on randy   probst randy on the run  randy in the water first  marcus moving on to the final  round  all right next round sugar  versus bob  were on  winner moves on to the final  round to join ace and marcus  great match  sugar not going anywhere  bob slips trying to hang on  bob is back up a great  recovery  sugar screams  bob in the water first  sugar moving on   congratulations   probst the log rolling  champion hits the water first  youll be ridiculed back home  laughter  for the final round all three  of you will be on the log at  the same time  groaning  take your spots  for the final round ace we  drew for spots you got the  middle  you guys put a foot on the log  hold it steady   you know i feel this win is  enormous so its important  that i win this challenge  if i can pull it off ill be  proud of myself  if not ill probably shoot  myself in the pinky toe   probst the challenge is on  three people on the log at once  the last person on the log wins  immunity  good footwork by all three  sugar with a nice save  another nice save by marcus  sugar on the run  another nice save  everybody still alive  sugar in the water first  its ace and marcus fighting  for immunity  great battle  ace in the water first  marcus wins individual immunity   whoo   probst congratulations  applause  marcus safe at tonights tribal  council  now to the twist this is yours  to read  read it out loud so everybody  can hear it   you will now assign immunity  to one member of the other  tribe  im going to give this to  sugar   probst sugar come on over  applause   my hope is that sugar is  smart enough to keep the  immunity idol to herself and  that might actually end up  giving us one of our biggest  surprises which would be  losing a big power player from  the fang tribe in ace matty  or crystal   probst sugar safe at  tonights tribal council for  fang  marcus is safe for kotas   when i saw sugar with the  immunity necklace around her  neck im like damn  this girl has two idols  she is now the most powerful  person in this game   who would you have picked  from the other tribe to give  immunity to   i dont know   you dont know   maybe susie   susie   yeah   yeah you think susies gonna  be gone tonight   i think thats irritating  people   oh  matty and ace theyre  thinking to get rid of crystal  and it all depends on the  pinup girl sugar  so yeah i will lie in this  game  i will do everything in my  power to get her to vote with  me because my life and crystals  life rests upon her  so basically this is honest  to god truth  this is whats happening around  camp  im not lying to you  matty goes were voting out  sugar next immunity challenge  and then crystals like okay  so then when crystal went away  i looked at ace im like  are we really voting out  sugar  and ace is like right now  sugar is really good for nothing  except for the hidden immunity  idol  they think youre like  clueless youre like a dumb  blonde or whatever  okay and ace thinks he has  you wrapped around his finger   okay  i dont trust kenny he might  have been lying to me  but i have been trusting the  biggest snake in the game so  far and ive known that  so i really dont know who to  trust at any point in this game   ace is like well i  actually got the hidden immunity  idol from her once i can  probably do that and then we can  blindside her and then ill have  the hidden immunity idol  and i was like oh my freaking  god this guy is a snake   you and i will say were  voting on crystal   we blindside ace   blindside ace today   and we dont have to worry  about the snake ever again   never again   i trust sugar and i trust  that she will go along with the  plan to vote out ace  she may be the pinup girl but  shes very smart   kenny has reassured me all is  well  i will truly believe sugar when  she writes aces name down  either shes going to write my  name or shes going to write  aces name   why  whos going to do that  theyd only have two votes  mattys with you   theyd have three votes   no itd be kenny and  crystal wouldnt it   i gave it back to you last  time  ill give it back to you this  time   oh ace i gotta think  about it okay   thats fine   you make me feel awful  when ace asked me for the idol  it made me think maybe kenny  was telling me the truth   dont you think after   ace definitely knows how to  finagle people much more than  ive ever seen anybody do  probably in my life  but hes definitely had my back   ill bring the last of it  and then thats it   all right go for it   crystals supposed to go  next but plans could change  ace could be turning on me now  i have no idea  oh god what am i gonna do with  this thing   probst sugar youve been  out here  days  tell me about camp life  whats going on   um we are very low on rice  crystal accidentally knocked  some over and she didnt eat  because she knocked it over   probst kenny how much rice  did you have before crystal  knocked it over   we had about seven days  worth  crystal ended up scooping some  of the rice that she spilled  outside back into the pot  so probably had about five and  a half days worth of rice   probst so matty the rice  is so valuable that if you  spill even a little in the dirt  you gotta pick it out grain by  grain   the rice is valuable  its the most valuable thing we  have  we get about six to eight  spoonfuls a day of rice   probst wow   and she spills the rice and  nobody goes god crystal  what are you doing nobody   no but your faces said it  all   just simmer down   your face said it all   my face says it all nobody  says a word to her   because they knew it was an  accident   exactly so just   i didnt purposely go over to  the rice box and just throw the  rice down   just let me get to my point  can i get to my point   get to your point and then  ill talk   so then we looked past it  we moved past that issue   probst ace make sense of  that for me   crystal made a mistake  thats common  the whole part of us feeling  angry at her i thought was a bit  concocted in her own head   now im delusional  i can see it on your face ace  okay dont look at me like  that  when matty turned around he was  like oh whatever  then he made some look at you  ace  i didnt say anything to  anybody  i just sat down there picking up  about  grains of rice  and then they started to eat  oh crystal come on and eat  no i spilled some of the rice  so i will go without and  thats what i did and thats  why i did it   nobody asked you to crystal   its not like you saved me  any anyways you still ate it   i asked you three times   yeah i mean if you cared  enough you wouldve saved me  some anyways   probst sugar you have  like the perfect seat in the  midst of this great  shakespearean drama   i know   probst your eyes are like  saucers   this sounds like such petty  bull crap to me  i mean i think that we can get  past our issues better than  this and this is why we havent  been winning because people are  holding these stupid petty  things against each other   probst all right sugar you  have individual immunity  tonight  you can assign that to somebody  else or keep it for yourself   keeping it   probst sugar is safe  tonight  everybody else is fair game  it is time to vote  ace youre up   youre one of the snakes and  i got to get rid of you  go home   crystal ive been waiting  for this day for so long and i  am so happy its here   probst ill go tally the  votes  if anybody has the hidden  immunity idol and you want to  play it now would be the time  to do so  okay once the votes are read  the decision is final  the person voted out will be  asked to leave the tribal  council area immediately  ill read the votes  first vote ace  crystal  one vote ace one vote crystal  ace  two votes ace one vote crystal  were tied  two votes crystal two votes  ace one vote left  seventh person voted out of  isurvivor gaboni  ace thats three  you need to bring me your torch   probst ace the tribe has  spoken   good luck guys   probst well based on the  reaction from ace id say that  was a blindside   days in fang is finally  starting to play this game  grab your torches  head back to camp  good night  dont go away  coming up next kota prepares  for their own tribal council   right now would be an  optimal time to get me out   probst while dan digs his  own grave  susie commits social suicide   i was actually going to vote  you   really  i hate her  i want her gone yesterday   can i ask you a question   what   im not going tonight am i   not that i know of  given the fact that everyones  voting for susie   it has to be susie cause  we have no idea  we could stay together as a  tribe for another two rounds  right now would be an optimal  time to get me out as a strong  player so this is a huge vote  for me because im either going  to come back here and trust  everyone or im going to be at  home eating a pizza   please trust us   yeah   and you know   andand that is incredible  faith on my part but i know i  got to do it   randys replaced bob in a  final four situation because i  think randys willing to cast  his lot in with a good group of  people and hes found that  and he you know as long as he  keeps his end of the bargain  hes got a great run for this  game   she knows shes low man on  the totem pole  shes bound to  she may continue to dig her  grave all day long andand  yalls conclusion may shift   of course   as annoying as bob is i see  him as being as loyal and  trustworthy as the day is long   andand right now i cant  say the same thing about dan   i cant either   but im closer being able to  say it about susie than i am  about dan   dan is super vulnerable  tonight  and the only thing dan has going  for him right now is that he  should really cross his fingers  that susies going to blow up  and do some crazy stuff   i really like you and i  dont want you to go home  so im not writing your name  down and i just wanted you to  know that  youre just not on my list of   do you know whowho theyre  thinking about voting out   um i think that its going  to be dan   thats what your your guess  is its gonna be dan   i think so yeah  but we felt like we dont want  to take somebody thats gonna  flip  i feel really good about the  fact that you wouldnt   no i wouldnt as long as  you keep me in the loop  ii figured people were talking  and i figured eventually they  would come to me and tell me  where im at you know  cause i when i was gonna  okay im gonna be honest with  you  i was actually going to vote  you because   why   because i know that im a  hard worker  ii know that without having  fire and water and food how are  you going to perform physically  youre going to have to take  that time to do that work   mmhmm   so im just being totally up  front with you so and  thats the truth   okay so you need me to help  more   well yeah i need help from  everybody actually  so thats where im at  but ii appreciate that cause  now i know which way i can  swing   so this moron has decided  that shed like me to go  really  i hate her  i hate her hate her hate her  like i really want to stab her  in the face  and if you piss me off youve  pissed off my alliance   did i not say to you guys  shes nuts  i mean certifiable   but shes the worst kind of  nuts cause you dont see it  coming   she goes whichever way the  wind is blowing   um i mean i hate her  i want her gone yesterday   susies game is no game  and the problem with no game is  her vote can be bought  shes gone   tonight i dont want any  sort of curveball  i do not want to go home  tonight  i dont know what could be  cooking  i mean dan doesnt have the  idol does he   not that i know of   what if susie and dan get  together dan has the idol  and hes like lets both  vote corinne   then youre gone   lets just take her out  then she has to go   everybodys ass is on the  line  susie needs to go  shes annoying  i want her to go home and soon   so um heres the thing  my entire plan was wedged on the  fact that susie is easy she  trusts us and shes never  gonna win individual immunity  we can get rid of her when we  want  i didnt realize she wasi locoi  ien la cabezai  like i had no idea that that  was what i was dealing with   i am devastated right now   well im completely  frustrated because i feel like  we got some issues that we had  no idea existed   what do you think is the  safer bet  cause im really a little  concerned   were at the point where  i think either decision has  incredible risks associated  with it   right   thank god we have a  twoperson advantage at this  point  but dan could have the  immunity idol  but i really doubt it so  if he actually does have the  immunity idol we should vote  out susie   yeah   just in case theres an idol   yeah  were worried that dan has the  immunity idol because he spent  a couple days on exile island  but we also think that dan may  need to go  so unfortunately its not who  is the best asset  its who is the least risky  which stinks because you know  we still dont know who were  gonna be better off with   probst marcus is the game  at a point where youre now  looking out for yourself versus  keeping our tribe strong   i think were basing our  decision on what were  expecting to come in the next  few days  weve got to surround ourselves  with the most powerful crowd of  people because thats the only  way were going to survive an  onslaught from the rest of the  fang tribe   probst susie looking at  this tribe you got to be a  little concerned yourself  is it fair to say that youre  the weakest person on this  tribe in challenges   ii dont think i am  i think theres certain skills  that i may be a little bit  weaker at but   probst whos weaker than  you on this tribe   um i think strengthwise  upper strength i think im  stronger than corinne   probst corinne not buying  that at all   i dont want to insult her  i think that she is very  skilled and i think that she  does have athletic talent you  know   probst she just insulted  you   well yes and thats why im  telling you that i dont agree  i think that i have a lot to  offer  i think i have upper body  strength  i think ive got a lot of  things but   and you probably do  i dont i mean im just im  trying to just kind of observe  and just kind of see where this  games taking me and   probst corinne have you  picked up on susies tendencies  to maybe sometimes let loose   yeah but ive operated  without a filter for so many  years that like i totally  respect when people come out of  their shell and just say  whatever it is that theyre  thinking  i mean i would encourage more  of that  maybe you should blow up once  in a while and then ill know  you better   probst randy where do you  sit on the be yourself versus  hold it in   im probably about eight on a  scale of ten and thats good  and bad   probst whats good about it   i dont have to pretend  and uh you know people pretty  much know where i stand most of  the time   probst whats bad about it   i dont have to pretend and  people know where i stand most  of the time  laughter   probst dan where do you fit  in on that   um i tend to be a  worrywart and so it has  inhibited me from being  completely comfortable and  completely myself  but my result in the game will  fare much better if i can shake  it off and just relax   probst charlie how big a  factor is trust becoming   days in for this group of  seven   its huge because we intend  to go into a merge as a  powerful group together  and if someone splinters our  numbers will dwindle before the  fang numbers dwindle  so my vote is based on who i can  trust going into a merge most   probst corinne is it  possible that tonights vote  could be a mistake   damn yeah  i dont know if were making  the right decision or if i  personally am making the right  decision  i hope that i am   probst all right lets get  to the vote  marcus thanks to a nice  performance today you have  individual immunity  it is yours unless you choose  to give it to somebody else   we won it for kota but im  going to hang on to this one   probst all right you cannot  vote for marcus  everybody else is fair game  it is time to vote  bob youre up   dan  sorry guy   susie you have a uh a  great heart and im going to  vote with what i think the rest  of the tribe is voting   this is about dan not you   probst ill go tally the  votes  if anybody has the hidden  immunity idol and you want to  play it now would be the time  to do so  okay once the votes are read  the decision is final  person voted out will be  asked to leave the tribal  council area immediately  ill read the votes  first vote susie  dan  dan  two votes dan one vote susie  susie  were tied two votes susie  two votes dan  dan  three votes dan two votes  susie  susie  were tied three votes susie  three votes dan  one vote left  eighth person voted out of  isurvivor gaboni  dan  need to bring me your torch  dan the tribe has spoken  its time for you to go   thanks jeff   probst well despite being  very successful this is not  one big happy family  grab your torches head back to  camp  good night  captioning sponsored by  cbs  captioned by  media access group at wgbh  accesswgbhorg  stay tuned for scenes from our  next episode   probst next time on  isurvivori  theres a new leader in africa  and they call him randy   i am king of gabon  im sorry but i rule  this ocean its mine  all those fang and kota  members they know the power is  shifting  im king  cheers   whoo   this pretty much blows  theres a definite level of  disappointment in relation to  sugar  matty i respect you you know  i wish you the best  icest la viei   um a lot of mixed feelings  right now  a little bit disappointed that  i didnt make it further in the  game  on the other hand it feels  good to be able to be myself  and i got some great friends and  family to go back to so thats  please rate this subtitle at wwwosdblinkahdta help other users to choose the best subtitles \"\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\":

take it back thank you good news and bad news about today challenge bad news is both tribe are going to tribal council tonight both tribe are gonna vote somebody out the good news each of you will have an equal shot at winning individual immunity it a log roll youre gonna match up against another tribe member it might be somebody from the other tribe it might be somebody from your own tribe your goal is to stay on the log longer than the other person first person to hit the water is out winner move on last person left standing win immunity and is safe at tonight tribal council i think i may have a target on my back so it very very important for me personally to go in there and win and not just win by a little win by a lot probst in addition there is a twist which will be revealed after the challenge is over another twist probst well draw number get our matchup well get started all right first matchup dan taking on ace all right here we go put a foot on the log three two one walk we are on first matchup good footwork dan is in the water ace move on to the next round next round charlie versus crystal this challenge is on charlie and crystal looking to move on crystal in the water first charlie moving on to the next round big matchup marcus versus matty good save by marcus mattys in the water marcus moving on to the next round randy taking on susie both from the kota tribe nice footwork ah susie in the water first randy moving on to the next round kenny versus sugar two fang member this dumb thing laugh i cant even move this probst can he fight to hang on no kenny in the water first sugar moving on last of the first round bob and corinne of course he did laughter probst who knew that would come in handy here we go bob versus corinne bob the former log roll winner three two one walk bob whistling sugar laughing corinne in the water first bob moving on all right semifinal round we have our matchup charlie taking on ace go come on charlie probst the winner move on to the final round ace staying alive charlies got him on the run great match ace on the run can he recover charlies in the water first ace moving on to the final very close now it is marcus taking on randy one of you will move on to the final round come on randy probst randy on the run randy in the water first marcus moving on to the final round all right next round sugar versus bob were on winner move on to the final round to join ace and marcus great match sugar not going anywhere bob slip trying to hang on bob is back up a great recovery sugar scream bob in the water first sugar moving on congratulation probst the log rolling champion hit the water first youll be ridiculed back home laughter for the final round all three of you will be on the log at the same time groaning take your spot for the final round ace we drew for spot you got the middle you guy put a foot on the log hold it steady you know i feel this win is enormous so it important that i win this challenge if i can pull it off ill be proud of myself if not ill probably shoot myself in the pinky toe probst the challenge is on three people on the log at once the last person on the log win immunity good footwork by all three sugar with a nice save another nice save by marcus sugar on the run another nice save everybody still alive sugar in the water first it ace and marcus fighting for immunity great battle ace in the water first marcus win individual immunity whoo probst congratulation applause marcus safe at tonight tribal council now to the twist this is yours to read read it out loud so everybody can hear it you will now assign immunity to one member of the other tribe im going to give this to sugar probst sugar come on over applause my hope is that sugar is smart enough to keep the immunity idol to herself and that might actually end up giving u one of our biggest surprise which would be losing a big power player from the fang tribe in ace matty or crystal probst sugar safe at tonight tribal council for fang marcus is safe for kota when i saw sugar with the immunity necklace around her neck im like damn this girl ha two idol she is now the most powerful person in this game who would you have picked from the other tribe to give immunity to i dont know you dont know maybe susie susie yeah yeah you think susies gonna be gone tonight i think thats irritating people oh matty and ace theyre thinking to get rid of crystal and it all depends on the pinup girl sugar so yeah i will lie in this game i will do everything in my power to get her to vote with me because my life and crystal life rest upon her so basically this is honest to god truth this is whats happening around camp im not lying to you matty go were voting out sugar next immunity challenge and then crystal like okay so then when crystal went away i looked at ace im like are we really voting out sugar and ace is like right now sugar is really good for nothing except for the hidden immunity idol they think youre like clueless youre like a dumb blonde or whatever okay and ace think he ha you wrapped around his finger okay i dont trust kenny he might have been lying to me but i have been trusting the biggest snake in the game so far and ive known that so i really dont know who to trust at any point in this game ace is like well i actually got the hidden immunity idol from her once i can probably do that and then we can blindside her and then ill have the hidden immunity idol and i wa like oh my freaking god this guy is a snake you and i will say were voting on crystal we blindside ace blindside ace today and we dont have to worry about the snake ever again never again i trust sugar and i trust that she will go along with the plan to vote out ace she may be the pinup girl but shes very smart kenny ha reassured me all is well i will truly believe sugar when she writes ace name down either shes going to write my name or shes going to write ace name why who going to do that theyd only have two vote mattys with you theyd have three vote no itd be kenny and crystal wouldnt it i gave it back to you last time ill give it back to you this time oh ace i gotta think about it okay thats fine you make me feel awful when ace asked me for the idol it made me think maybe kenny wa telling me the truth dont you think after ace definitely know how to finagle people much more than ive ever seen anybody do probably in my life but he definitely had my back ill bring the last of it and then thats it all right go for it crystal supposed to go next but plan could change ace could be turning on me now i have no idea oh god what am i gonna do with this thing probst sugar youve been out here day tell me about camp life whats going on um we are very low on rice crystal accidentally knocked some over and she didnt eat because she knocked it over probst kenny how much rice did you have before crystal knocked it over we had about seven day worth crystal ended up scooping some of the rice that she spilled outside back into the pot so probably had about five and a half day worth of rice probst so matty the rice is so valuable that if you spill even a little in the dirt you gotta pick it out grain by grain the rice is valuable it the most valuable thing we have we get about six to eight spoonful a day of rice probst wow and she spill the rice and nobody go god crystal what are you doing nobody no but your face said it all just simmer down your face said it all my face say it all nobody say a word to her because they knew it wa an accident exactly so just i didnt purposely go over to the rice box and just throw the rice down just let me get to my point can i get to my point get to your point and then ill talk so then we looked past it we moved past that issue probst ace make sense of that for me crystal made a mistake thats common the whole part of u feeling angry at her i thought wa a bit concocted in her own head now im delusional i can see it on your face ace okay dont look at me like that when matty turned around he wa like oh whatever then he made some look at you ace i didnt say anything to anybody i just sat down there picking up about grain of rice and then they started to eat oh crystal come on and eat no i spilled some of the rice so i will go without and thats what i did and thats why i did it nobody asked you to crystal it not like you saved me any anyways you still ate it i asked you three time yeah i mean if you cared enough you wouldve saved me some anyways probst sugar you have like the perfect seat in the midst of this great shakespearean drama i know probst your eye are like saucer this sound like such petty bull crap to me i mean i think that we can get past our issue better than this and this is why we havent been winning because people are holding these stupid petty thing against each other probst all right sugar you have individual immunity tonight you can assign that to somebody else or keep it for yourself keeping it probst sugar is safe tonight everybody else is fair game it is time to vote ace youre up youre one of the snake and i got to get rid of you go home crystal ive been waiting for this day for so long and i am so happy it here probst ill go tally the vote if anybody ha the hidden immunity idol and you want to play it now would be the time to do so okay once the vote are read the decision is final the person voted out will be asked to leave the tribal council area immediately ill read the vote first vote ace crystal one vote ace one vote crystal ace two vote ace one vote crystal were tied two vote crystal two vote ace one vote left seventh person voted out of isurvivor gaboni ace thats three you need to bring me your torch probst ace the tribe ha spoken good luck guy probst well based on the reaction from ace id say that wa a blindside day in fang is finally starting to play this game grab your torch head back to camp good night dont go away coming up next kota prepares for their own tribal council right now would be an optimal time to get me out probst while dan dig his own grave susie commits social suicide i wa actually going to vote you really i hate her i want her gone yesterday can i ask you a question what im not going tonight am i not that i know of given the fact that everyones voting for susie it ha to be susie cause we have no idea we could stay together a a tribe for another two round right now would be an optimal time to get me out a a strong player so this is a huge vote for me because im either going to come back here and trust everyone or im going to be at home eating a pizza please trust u yeah and you know andand that is incredible faith on my part but i know i got to do it randys replaced bob in a final four situation because i think randys willing to cast his lot in with a good group of people and he found that and he you know a long a he keep his end of the bargain he got a great run for this game she know shes low man on the totem pole shes bound to she may continue to dig her grave all day long andand yalls conclusion may shift of course a annoying a bob is i see him a being a loyal and trustworthy a the day is long andand right now i cant say the same thing about dan i cant either but im closer being able to say it about susie than i am about dan dan is super vulnerable tonight and the only thing dan ha going for him right now is that he should really cross his finger that susies going to blow up and do some crazy stuff i really like you and i dont want you to go home so im not writing your name down and i just wanted you to know that youre just not on my list of do you know whowho theyre thinking about voting out um i think that it going to be dan thats what your your guess is it gonna be dan i think so yeah but we felt like we dont want to take somebody thats gonna flip i feel really good about the fact that you wouldnt no i wouldnt a long a you keep me in the loop ii figured people were talking and i figured eventually they would come to me and tell me where im at you know cause i when i wa gonna okay im gonna be honest with you i wa actually going to vote you because why because i know that im a hard worker ii know that without having fire and water and food how are you going to perform physically youre going to have to take that time to do that work mmhmm so im just being totally up front with you so and thats the truth okay so you need me to help more well yeah i need help from everybody actually so thats where im at but ii appreciate that cause now i know which way i can swing so this moron ha decided that shed like me to go really i hate her i hate her hate her hate her like i really want to stab her in the face and if you piss me off youve pissed off my alliance did i not say to you guy shes nut i mean certifiable but shes the worst kind of nut cause you dont see it coming she go whichever way the wind is blowing um i mean i hate her i want her gone yesterday susies game is no game and the problem with no game is her vote can be bought shes gone tonight i dont want any sort of curveball i do not want to go home tonight i dont know what could be cooking i mean dan doesnt have the idol doe he not that i know of what if susie and dan get together dan ha the idol and he like let both vote corinne then youre gone let just take her out then she ha to go everybodys as is on the line susie need to go shes annoying i want her to go home and soon so um here the thing my entire plan wa wedged on the fact that susie is easy she trust u and shes never gonna win individual immunity we can get rid of her when we want i didnt realize she wasi locoi ien la cabezai like i had no idea that that wa what i wa dealing with i am devastated right now well im completely frustrated because i feel like we got some issue that we had no idea existed what do you think is the safer bet cause im really a little concerned were at the point where i think either decision ha incredible risk associated with it right thank god we have a twoperson advantage at this point but dan could have the immunity idol but i really doubt it so if he actually doe have the immunity idol we should vote out susie yeah just in case there an idol yeah were worried that dan ha the immunity idol because he spent a couple day on exile island but we also think that dan may need to go so unfortunately it not who is the best asset it who is the least risky which stink because you know we still dont know who were gonna be better off with probst marcus is the game at a point where youre now looking out for yourself versus keeping our tribe strong i think were basing our decision on what were expecting to come in the next few day weve got to surround ourselves with the most powerful crowd of people because thats the only way were going to survive an onslaught from the rest of the fang tribe probst susie looking at this tribe you got to be a little concerned yourself is it fair to say that youre the weakest person on this tribe in challenge ii dont think i am i think there certain skill that i may be a little bit weaker at but probst who weaker than you on this tribe um i think strengthwise upper strength i think im stronger than corinne probst corinne not buying that at all i dont want to insult her i think that she is very skilled and i think that she doe have athletic talent you know probst she just insulted you well yes and thats why im telling you that i dont agree i think that i have a lot to offer i think i have upper body strength i think ive got a lot of thing but and you probably do i dont i mean im just im trying to just kind of observe and just kind of see where this game taking me and probst corinne have you picked up on susies tendency to maybe sometimes let loose yeah but ive operated without a filter for so many year that like i totally respect when people come out of their shell and just say whatever it is that theyre thinking i mean i would encourage more of that maybe you should blow up once in a while and then ill know you better probst randy where do you sit on the be yourself versus hold it in im probably about eight on a scale of ten and thats good and bad probst whats good about it i dont have to pretend and uh you know people pretty much know where i stand most of the time probst whats bad about it i dont have to pretend and people know where i stand most of the time laughter probst dan where do you fit in on that um i tend to be a worrywart and so it ha inhibited me from being completely comfortable and completely myself but my result in the game will fare much better if i can shake it off and just relax probst charlie how big a factor is trust becoming day in for this group of seven it huge because we intend to go into a merge a a powerful group together and if someone splinter our number will dwindle before the fang number dwindle so my vote is based on who i can trust going into a merge most probst corinne is it possible that tonight vote could be a mistake damn yeah i dont know if were making the right decision or if i personally am making the right decision i hope that i am probst all right let get to the vote marcus thanks to a nice performance today you have individual immunity it is yours unless you choose to give it to somebody else we won it for kota but im going to hang on to this one probst all right you cannot vote for marcus everybody else is fair game it is time to vote bob youre up dan sorry guy susie you have a uh a great heart and im going to vote with what i think the rest of the tribe is voting this is about dan not you probst ill go tally the vote if anybody ha the hidden immunity idol and you want to play it now would be the time to do so okay once the vote

your goal is to stay on the log longer than the other person first person to hit the water is out winner move on last person left standing win immunity and is safe at tonight tribal council i think i may have a target on my back so it very very important for me personally to go in there and win and not just win by a little win by a lot probst in addition there is a twist which will be revealed after the challenge is over another twist probst well draw number get our matchup well get started all right first matchup dan taking on ace all right here we go put a foot on the log three two one walk we are on first matchup good footwork dan is in the water ace move on to the next round next round charlie versus crystal this challenge is on charlie and crystal looking to move on crystal in

moving on congratulation probst the log rolling champion hit the water first youll be ridiculed back home laughter for the final round all three of you will be on the log at the same time groaning take your spot for the final round ace we drew for spot you got the middle you guy put a foot on the log hold it steady you know i feel this win is enormous so it important that i win this challenge if i can pull it off ill be proud of myself if not ill probably shoot myself in the pinky toe probst the challenge is on three people on the log at once the last person on the log win immunity good footwork by all three sugar with a nice save another nice save by marcus sugar on the run another nice save everybody still alive sugar in the water first it ace and marcus fighting for immunity great battle ace in the water first marcus win individual immunity whoo probst congratulation applause marcus safe at tonight tribal council now to the twist this is yours to read read it out loud so everybody can hear it you will now assign immunity to one member of the other tribe im going to give this to sugar probst sugar come on over applause my hope is that sugar is smart enough to keep the immunity idol to herself and that might actually end up giving u one of our biggest surprise which would be losing a big power player from the fang tribe in ace matty or crystal probst sugar safe at tonight tribal council for fang marcus is safe for kota when i saw sugar with the immunity necklace around her neck im like damn this girl ha two idol she is now the most powerful person in this game who would you have picked from the other tribe to give immunity to i dont know you dont know maybe susie susie yeah yeah you think susies gonna be gone tonight i think thats irritating people oh matty and ace theyre thinking to get rid of crystal and it all depends on the pinup girl sugar so yeah i will lie in this game i will do everything in my power to get her to vote with me because my life and crystal life rest upon her so basically this is honest to god truth this is whats happening around camp im not lying to you matty go were voting out sugar next immunity challenge and then crystal like okay so then when crystal went away i looked at ace im like are we really voting out sugar and ace is like right now sugar is really good for nothing except for the hidden immunity idol they think youre like clueless youre like a dumb blonde or whatever okay and ace think he ha you wrapped around his finger okay i dont trust kenny he might have been lying to me but i have been trusting the biggest snake in the game so far and ive known that so i really dont know who to trust at any point in this game ace is like well i actually got the hidden immunity idol from her once i can probably do that and then we can blindside her and then ill have the hidden immunity idol and i wa like oh my freaking god this guy is a snake you and i will say were voting on crystal we blindside ace blindside ace today and we dont have to worry about the snake ever again never again i trust sugar and i trust that she will go along with the plan to vote out ace she may be the pinup girl but shes very smart kenny ha reassured me all is well i will truly believe sugar when she writes ace name down either shes going to write my name or shes going to write ace name why who going to do that theyd only have two vote mattys with you theyd have three vote no itd be kenny and crystal wouldnt it i gave it back to you last time ill give it back to you this time oh ace i gotta think about it okay thats fine you make me feel awful when ace asked me for the idol it made me think maybe kenny wa telling me the truth dont you think after ace definitely know how to finagle people much more than ive ever seen anybody do probably in my life but he definitely had my back ill bring the last of it and then thats it all right go for it crystal supposed to go next but plan could change ace could be turning on me now i have no idea oh god what am i gonna do with this thing probst sugar youve been out here day tell me about camp life whats going on um we are very low on rice crystal accidentally knocked some over and she didnt eat because she knocked it over probst kenny how much rice did you have before crystal knocked it over we had about seven day worth crystal ended up scooping some of the rice that she spilled outside back into the pot so probably had about five and a half day worth of rice probst so matty the rice is so valuable that if you spill even a little in the dirt you gotta pick it out grain by grain the rice is valuable it the most valuable thing we have we get about six to eight spoonful a day of rice probst wow and she spill the rice and nobody go god crystal what are you doing nobody no but your face said it all just simmer down your face said it all my face say it all nobody say a word to her because they knew it wa an accident exactly so just i didnt purposely go over to the rice box and just throw the rice down just let me get to my point can i get to my point get to your point and then ill talk so then we looked past it we moved past that issue probst ace make sense of that for me crystal made a mistake thats common the whole part of u feeling angry at her i thought wa a bit concocted in her own head now im delusional i can see it on your face ace okay dont look at me like that when matty turned around he wa like oh whatever then he made some look at you ace i didnt say anything to anybody i just sat down there picking up about grain of rice and then they started to eat oh crystal come on and eat no i spilled some of the rice so i will go without and thats what i did and thats why i did it nobody asked you to crystal it not like you saved me any anyways you still ate it i asked you three time yeah i mean if you cared enough you wouldve saved me some anyways probst sugar you have like the perfect seat in the midst of this great shakespearean drama i know probst your eye are like saucer this sound like such petty bull crap to me i mean i think that we can get past our issue better than this and this is why we havent been winning because people are holding these stupid petty thing against each other probst all right sugar you have individual immunity tonight you can assign that to somebody else or keep it for yourself keeping it probst sugar is safe tonight everybody else is fair game it is time to vote ace youre up youre one of the snake and i got to get rid of you go home crystal ive been waiting for this day for so long and i am so happy it here probst ill go tally the vote if anybody ha the hidden immunity idol and you want to play it now would be the time to do so okay once the vote are read the decision is final the person voted out will be asked to leave the tribal council area immediately ill read the vote first vote ace crystal one vote ace one vote crystal ace two vote ace one vote crystal were tied two vote crystal two vote ace one vote left seventh person voted out of isurvivor gaboni ace thats three you need to bring me your torch probst ace the tribe ha spoken good luck guy probst well based on the reaction from ace id say that wa a blindside day in fang is finally starting to play this game grab your torch head back to camp good night dont go away coming up next kota prepares for their own tribal council right now would be an optimal time to get me out probst while dan dig his own grave susie commits social suicide i wa actually going to vote you really i hate her i want her gone yesterday can i ask you a question what im not going tonight am i not that i know of given the fact that everyones voting for susie it ha to be susie cause we have no idea we could stay together a a tribe for another two round right now would be an optimal time to get me out a a strong player so this is a huge vote for me because im either going to come back here and trust everyone or im going to be at home eating a pizza please trust u yeah and you know andand that is incredible faith on my part but i know i got to do it randys replaced bob in a final four situation because i think randys willing to cast his lot in with a good group of people and he found that and he you know a long a he keep his end of the bargain he got a great run for this game she know shes low man on the totem pole shes bound to she may continue to dig her grave all day long andand yalls conclusion may shift of course a annoying a bob is i see him a being a loyal and trustworthy a the day is long andand right now i cant say the same thing about dan i cant either but im closer being able to say it about susie than i am about dan dan is super vulnerable tonight and the only thing dan ha going for him right now is that he should really cross his finger that susies going to blow up and do some crazy stuff i really like you and i dont want you to go home so im not writing your name down and i just wanted you to know that youre just not on my list of do you know whowho theyre thinking about voting out um i think that it going to be dan thats what your your guess is it gonna be dan i think so yeah but we felt like we dont want to take somebody thats gonna flip i feel really good about the fact that you wouldnt no i wouldnt a long a you keep me in the loop ii figured people were talking and i figured eventually they would come to me and tell me where im at you know cause i when i wa gonna okay im gonna be honest with you i wa actually going to vote you because why because i know that im a hard worker ii know that without having fire and water and food how are you going to perform physically youre going to have to take that time to do that work mmhmm so im just being totally up front with you so and thats the truth okay so you need me to help more well yeah i need help from everybody actually so thats where im at but ii appreciate that cause now i know which way i can swing so this moron ha decided that shed like me to go really i hate her i hate her hate her hate her like i really want to stab her in the face and if you piss me off youve pissed off my alliance did i not say to you guy shes nut i mean certifiable but shes the worst kind of nut cause you dont see it coming she go whichever way the wind is blowing um i mean i hate her i want her gone yesterday susies game is no game and the problem with no game is her vote can be bought shes gone tonight i dont want any sort of curveball i do not want to go home tonight i dont know what could be cooking i mean dan doesnt have the idol doe he not that i know of what if susie and dan get together dan ha the idol and he like let both vote corinne then youre gone let just take her out then she ha to go everybodys as is on the line susie need to go shes annoying i want her to go home and soon so um here the thing my entire plan wa wedged on the fact that susie is easy she trust u and shes never gonna win individual immunity we can get rid of her when we want i didnt realize she wasi locoi ien la cabezai like i had no idea that that wa what i wa dealing with i am devastated right now well im completely frustrated because i feel like we got some issue that we had no idea existed what do you think is the safer bet cause im really a little concerned were at the point where i think either decision ha incredible risk associated with it right thank god we have a twoperson advantage at this point but dan could have the immunity idol but i really doubt it so if he actually doe have the immunity idol we should vote out susie yeah just in case there an idol yeah were worried that dan ha the immunity idol because he spent a couple day on exile island but we also think that dan may need to go so unfortunately it not who is the best asset it who is the least risky which stink because you know we still dont know who were gonna be better off with probst marcus is the game at a point where youre now looking out for yourself versus keeping our tribe strong i think were basing our decision on what were expecting to come in the next few day weve got to surround ourselves with the most powerful crowd of people because thats the only way were going to survive an onslaught from the rest of the fang tribe probst susie looking at this tribe you got to be a little concerned yourself is it fair to say that youre the weakest person on this tribe in challenge ii dont think i am i think there certain skill that i may be a little bit weaker at but probst who weaker than you on this tribe um i think strengthwise upper strength i think im stronger than corinne probst corinne not buying that at all i dont want to insult her i think that she is very skilled and i think that she doe have athletic talent you know probst she just insulted you well yes and thats why im telling you that i dont agree i think that i have a lot to offer i think i have upper body strength i think ive got a lot of thing but and you probably do i dont i mean im just im trying to just kind of observe and just kind of see where this game taking me and probst corinne have you picked up on susies tendency to maybe sometimes let loose yeah but ive operated without a filter for so many year that like i totally respect when people come out of their shell and just say whatever it is that theyre thinking i mean i would encourage more of that maybe you should blow up once in a while and then ill know you better probst randy where do you sit on the be yourself versus hold it in im probably about eight on a scale of ten and thats good and bad probst whats good about it i dont have to pretend and uh you know people pretty much know where i stand most of the time probst whats bad about it i dont have to pretend and people know where i stand most of the time laughter probst dan where do you fit in on that um i tend to be a worrywart and so it ha inhibited me from being completely comfortable and completely myself but my result in the game will fare much better if i can shake it off and just relax probst charlie how big a factor is trust becoming day in for this group of seven it huge because we intend to go into a merge a a powerful group together and if someone splinter our number will dwindle before the fang number dwindle so my vote is based on who i can trust going into a merge most probst corinne is it possible that tonight vote could be a mistake damn yeah i dont know if were making the right decision or if i personally am making the right decision i hope that i am probst all right let get to the vote marcus thanks to a nice performance today you have individual immunity it is yours unless you choose to give it to somebody else we won it for kota but im going to hang on to this one probst all right you cannot vote for marcus everybody else is fair game it is time to vote bob youre up dan sorry guy susie you have a uh a great heart and im going to vote with what i think the rest of the tribe is voting this is about dan not you probst ill go tally the vote if anybody ha the hidden immunity idol and you want to play it now would be the time to do so okay once the vote are read the decision is final person voted out will be asked to leave the tribal council area immediately ill read the vote first vote susie dan dan two vote dan one vote susie susie were tied two

job  thats fair enough  well be in touch  chattering  inspector palmer can i see you a minute  was it necessary to let everyone in the station know i was coming here to see these guys  you believe

this the pickups are made by  retired policemen  that way no plainclothes men are directly involved  now we need investigative help on this one chief  well inspector if you need investigative help  and you dont trust your own men  why dont you requisition some recruits from the police academy  with all due respect sir  backing us up is the only hope that the police department has got  there are good cops whod come forward  if there was any encouragement in the department to do so  and if they thought it would do any good if not they wont do it  ive done a whole lot more than most people to defend and preserve  the image of this department and protect commissioner delaney  against reckless and irresponsible assaults from outside agencies  thats it huh  i mean thats whats really important

do  delaneys gonna issue some phoney denial  somebody from the mayors office will say something noble  delaney will change his tune finally the mayor will appoint a commission  serpico thursday mayor lindsay announced the formation of a special committee  to review the city procedures for investigating police corruption  how come im not in the first paragraph  unbelievable  yeehoo  the times report smells of the familiar smear tactics of mccarthyism  this government must and will root out corruption  with every means at our command  the mayor has this day appointed a special investigation commission  knocking  to be headed by whitman knapp yeah come  heres your reward frank  its a transfer to narcotics brooklyn south  still in clothes you get a tin shield you dont get a gold one  i miss you already frank  look  frank  its narcotics  you be careful  its very easy to get hurt  and to  to be set up  gunshot  serpico  get in  youre not wired are you  okay you cocksucker  you might get by in the bronx with that kind of shit  but down here  a month is chicken feed  last week one dope dealer sent out these guys making pickups  forty thousand each  we let them collect it all and then hit them  a hundred and twenty thousand split four ways  thats serious money  and with that you dont fuck around  i got the message  good now get the fuck out  the guys name is limbo he just uses this place  his girlfriends brothers place hes a pusher heroin  were gonna drive to the corner  right and you keep in sight out front  when you spot somebody whos dirty take off your glasses and wipe them  right right okay  serpico if we stay here very long  were gonna get spotted heinemann well frank  why dont you go up there and check it out  well why dont you i got the wrong clothes  ill take you shopping uhhuh  dogs barking  man limbo  gerardo  speaking quietly in spanish  heinemann police freeze  police officer all right  to the wall against the wall  goddamn it get up  all right palms up on the wall and spread them  get them up spread them hands up come on  spread them feet apart  i saw the buy lets get limbo  julio you all right  julio yeah yeah i got them  speaking spanish  limbo speaks spanish  serpico police officer  yelling in spanish  what the fuck are you waiting for  heinemann police throw out your guns and come out with your hands up  groaning  chattering  what do you got here its mr and mrs serpico sir  okay  yes  speaking italian  wheres our son theyre bringing him down from xray  we want to see him just a few minutes  mr and mrs serpico the news is better than we expected  speaking italian  thank god the bullet was a small calibre  it didnt enter the brain  or strike the spinal cord  hes on the critical list  but his condition seems to be stable  thank you doctor thank you  stay out of there didnt they tell you  what  the word is dont talk to him hes no fucking good  how you doing kid serpico thickly hello sid  how are you  wanna read my fan mail  sure  youre a big shot now huh  sid  i want you to get those fucking cops away from my door  the knapp commission likes you they want you to appear  well naturally  frank heinemann and julio are cleared  the three of you are up for exceptional merit awards  thats very funny  its very funny  francesco you love me  i always had a thing for you sid you know that  your gold shields come through  clicks tongue  chuckles  whats this for  for being an honest cop  hm  or for being stupid enough to get shot in the face  you tell them they can shove it  i dont want it  oh well  mumbles  well frank the facts are these  youll have to stay on leave of absence for a few months  in all probability the hearing in your left ear wont come back  two bullet fragments are still lodged in the bony portion  one is very close to the carotid artery  and youll have to be checked from time to time  your left side will feel stiff occasionally  once in a great while you may experience some dizziness  but in general youll be okay    through my appearance here today  i hope that police officers in the future  will not experience the same frustration and anxiety  that i was subjected to for the past five years  at the hands of my superiors  because of my attempt to report corruption  i was made to feel that i had burdened them  with an unwanted task  the problem is that the atmosphere does not yet exist  in which an honest police officer  can act without fear of ridicule or reprisal from fellow officers  police corruption cannot exist  unless it is at least tolerated at higher levels in the department  therefore the most important result that can come from these hearings  is a conviction by police officers that the department will change  in order to ensure this  an independent permanent investigative body  dealing with police corruption like this commission is essential  audience applauding    subtitles by sdi media group  watch any video online with opensubtitles free browser

yeah im here to break  records you know laughs   probst all right sugar get  your stuff   sugar is a pinup model  she is completely worthless when  it comes to challenges  so when it comes to sugar in  this game i would really  really really desire her to go   probst kota it should be a  fun afternoon  indistinct chatter  fang i got nothing for you   we lost the biggest reward  yet  its hard you know when you  see them walking away  they have everything and we  have nothing  and we see kota in their  beautiful chopper just lavishing  in their reward you know  its madness its total  madness      reward was a helicopter ride  and i was lucky enough to have  ithei frontrow seat  just seeing that incredible  crater it made my trip to  africa  the only thing that was beating  faster than the rotors on that  helicopter was the beating of my  heart   oh wow   close as i want to get   holy cow   stay away from the edge   youre making me nervous  marcus  the beautiful scenery it was  awesome  its something i thought i would  never experience so it just  gives you more incentive more  power more strength to know  that you can get through this  no matter what  so it was very it was very  surreal for me  it was just amazing   lets get our blanket out   this is great lets get our  blanket out   sardines haha   i dont think in  my entire  years of living  ive ever been so embarrassed  im humiliated i felt pathetic  my spirits are dropping so fast  i look over and like sugar  shes just she cant do  anything  shes just being dominated  it was pointless for us to even  keep going  she was just standing there  getting walked all over  i hate it  im starting to get pissed  as long as theres physical  challenges were gonna lose  want to take a boat ride ace   sure bro   we need to take out sugar  okay this is what we do  we go kenny crystal and i vote  for sugar  you dont have to vote for  sugar so youre not  backstabbing her okay  sugars gone and its you and i  to the merge a hundred percent  theres no question   you know were a hundred  percent you and me   no i dont know that  were aligned  me and you are aligned so make  me comfortable  we need to take out sugar or at  least get the idol out   yeah i see the logic dude  i see that logic   okay we know exactly where  its sitting and we can use it  to our advantage when we have  to   you know what theyre  talking about right cri   yeah those two asses out  there in the boat trying to get  me off   they are will you trust me   ive been there with you  from day one kenny   we have to blindside ace   yeah   i have to talk to sugar  crystal you trust me a  hundred percent right   i trust you a hundred  percent   okay   i can feel ace right now  strategically wants to get rid  of me  the way that hes manipulating  matty hes a devil  and he has to go   this is this is awesome   getting this is just  incomparable   and the best part about this  is they dont get it   and they may be completely  out of rice to add insult to  injury   oh oh   what is this   oh my   oh my god   wait stop everyone shh   holy cow these are letters  from home   oh my god theyre letters  oh my god oh my god  gasps  oh

never writes  anything and he wrote me a  letter   isnt that cool   he never writes anything  he wasnt even excited  he didnt show any excitement  when i was leaving  wow   you should receive  i cant read it  my eyes keep blurring  im close to these people here  but these are the people that  are the closest to my heart  life is good  and i realize how lucky a man i  am  im here  and i cant  i cant wait to get home to  them  life doesnt get better than  this   back to the sugar shack  for me  i dont really know what the  hells happening in this game  im just  trying to survive laughs  thank god for ace  whats funny is im pretty sure  were using each other but i  feel like my tribe thinks im  naive and that im sticking  with him out of stupidity but  im sticking with him because  hes the strongest player at  this point  so i just hope that theyre not  all screwing me around   probst come on in guys  well now bring in sugar  returning from exile island   probst all right you guys  ready to get to todays  immunity challenge   yeah   probst first things first  dan i will take it back  thank you  good news and bad news about  todays challenge  bad news is both tribes are  going to tribal council tonight  both tribes are gonna vote  somebody out  the good news each of you will  have an equal shot at winning  individual immunity  its a log roll  youre gonna match up  against another tribe member  it might be somebody from the  other tribe  it might be somebody from your  own tribe  your goal is to stay on the log  longer than the other person  first person to hit the water  is out  winners move on  last person left standing wins  immunity and is safe at  tonights tribal council   i think i may have a target  on my back so its very very  important for me personally to  go in there and win and not  just win by a little  win by a lot   probst in addition there is  a twist which will be revealed  after the challenge is over   another twist   probst well draw numbers  get our matchups well get  started  all right first matchup dan  taking on ace  all right here we go  put a foot on the log  three two one walk  we are on first matchup  good footwork  dan is in the water  ace moves on to the next round  next round charlie versus  crystal  this challenge is on  charlie and crystal looking to  move on  crystal in the water first  charlie moving on to the next  round  big matchup marcus versus  matty  good save by marcus  mattys in the water  marcus moving on to the next  round  randy taking on susie  both from the kota tribe  nice footwork  ah susie in the water first  randy moving on to the next  round  kenny versus sugar  two fang members   this dumb thing laughs   i cant even move this   probst can he fight to hang  on  no kenny in the water first  sugar moving on  last of the first rounds bob  and corinne   of course he did  laughter   probst who knew that would  come in handy  here we go bob versus corinne  bob the former log roll winner  three two one walk  bob whistling sugar laughing  corinne in the water first  bob moving on  all right semifinal round  we have our matchups  charlie taking on ace  go   come on charlie   probst the winner moves on  to the final round  ace staying alive  charlies got him on the run  great match ace on the run  can he recover  charlies in the water first  ace moving on to the final  very close  now it is marcus taking on  randy  one of you will move on to the  final round   come on randy   probst randy on the run  randy in the water first  marcus moving on to the final  round  all right next round sugar  versus bob  were on  winner moves on to the final  round to join ace and marcus  great match  sugar not going anywhere  bob slips trying to hang on  bob is back up a great  recovery  sugar screams  bob in the water first  sugar moving on   congratulations   probst the log rolling  champion hits the water first  youll be ridiculed back home  laughter  for the final round all three  of you will be on the log at  the same time  groaning  take your spots  for the final round ace we  drew for spots you got the  middle  you guys put a foot on the log  hold it steady   you know i feel this win is  enormous so its important  that i win this challenge  if i can pull it off ill be  proud of myself  if not ill probably shoot  myself in the pinky toe   probst the challenge is on  three people on the log at once  the last person on the log wins  immunity  good footwork by all three  sugar with a nice save  another nice save by marcus  sugar on the run  another nice save  everybody still alive  sugar in the water first  its ace and marcus fighting  for immunity  great battle  ace in the water first  marcus wins individual immunity   whoo   probst congratulations  applause  marcus safe at tonights tribal  council  now to the twist this is yours  to read  read it out loud so everybody  can hear it   you will now assign immunity  to one member of the other  tribe  im going to give this to  sugar   probst sugar come on over  applause   my hope is that sugar is  smart enough to keep the  immunity idol to herself and  that might actually end up  giving us one of our biggest  surprises which would be  losing a big power player from  the fang tribe in ace matty  or crystal   probst sugar safe at  tonights tribal council for  fang  marcus is safe for kotas   when i saw sugar with the  immunity necklace around her  neck im like damn  this girl has two idols  she is now the most powerful  person in this game   who would you have picked  from the other tribe to give  immunity to   i dont know   you dont know   maybe susie   susie   yeah   yeah you think susies gonna  be gone tonight   i think thats irritating  people   oh  matty and ace theyre  thinking to get rid of crystal  and it all depends on the  pinup girl sugar  so yeah i will lie in this  game  i will do everything in my  power to get her to vote with  me because my life and crystals  life rests upon her  so basically this is honest  to god truth  this is whats happening around  camp  im not lying to you  matty goes were voting out  sugar next immunity challenge  and then crystals like okay  so then when crystal went away  i looked at ace im like  are we really voting out  sugar  and ace is like right now  sugar is really good for nothing  except for the hidden immunity  idol  they think youre like  clueless youre like a dumb  blonde or whatever  okay and ace thinks he has  you wrapped around his finger   okay  i dont trust kenny he might  have been lying to me  but i have been trusting the  biggest snake in the game so  far and ive known that  so i really dont know who to  trust at any point in this game   ace is like well i  actually got the hidden immunity  idol from her once i can  probably do that and then we can  blindside her and then ill have  the hidden immunity idol  and i was like oh my freaking  god this guy is a snake   you and i will say were  voting on crystal   we blindside ace   blindside ace today   and we dont have to worry  about the snake ever again   never again   i trust sugar and i trust  that she will go along with the  plan to vote out ace  she may be the pinup girl but  shes very smart   kenny has reassured me all is  well  i will truly believe sugar when  she writes aces name down  either shes going to write my  name or shes going to write  aces name   why  whos going to do that  theyd only have two votes  mattys with you   theyd have three votes   no itd be kenny and  crystal wouldnt it   i gave it back to you last  time  ill give it back to you this  time   oh ace i gotta think  about it okay   thats fine   you make me feel awful  when ace asked me for the idol  it made me think maybe kenny  was telling me the truth   dont you think after   ace definitely knows how to  finagle people much more than  ive ever seen anybody do  probably in my life  but hes definitely had my back   ill bring the last of it  and then thats it   all right go for it   crystals supposed to go  next but plans could change  ace could be turning on me now  i have no idea  oh god what am i gonna do with  this thing   probst sugar youve been  out here  days  tell me about camp life  whats going on   um we are very low on rice  crystal accidentally knocked  some over and she didnt eat  because she knocked it over   probst kenny how much rice  did you have before crystal  knocked it over   we had about seven days  worth  crystal ended up scooping some  of the rice that she spilled  outside back into the pot  so probably had about five and  a half days worth of rice   probst so matty the rice  is so valuable that if you  spill even a little in the dirt  you gotta pick it out grain by  grain   the rice is valuable  its the most valuable thing we  have  we get about six to eight  spoonfuls a day of rice   probst wow   and she spills the rice and  nobody goes god crystal  what are you doing nobody   no but your faces said it  all   just simmer down   your face said it all   my face says it all nobody  says a word to her   because they knew it was an  accident   exactly so just   i didnt purposely go over to  the rice box and just throw the  rice down   just let me get to my point  can i get to my point   get to your point and then  ill talk   so then we looked past it  we moved past that issue   probst ace make sense of  that for me   crystal made a mistake  thats common  the whole part of us feeling  angry at her i thought was a bit  concocted in her own head   now im delusional  i can see it on your face ace  okay dont look at me like  that  when matty turned around he was  like oh whatever  then he made some look at you  ace  i didnt say anything to  anybody  i just sat down there picking up  about  grains of rice  and then they started to eat  oh crystal come on and eat  no i spilled some of the rice  so i will go without and  thats what i did and thats  why i did it   nobody asked you to crystal   its not like you saved me  any anyways you still ate it   i asked you three times   yeah i mean if you cared  enough you wouldve saved me  some anyways   probst sugar you have  like the perfect seat in the  midst of this great  shakespearean drama   i know   probst your eyes are like  saucers   this sounds like such petty  bull crap to me  i mean i think that we can get  past our issues better than  this and this is why we havent  been winning because people are  holding these stupid petty  things against each other   probst all right sugar you  have individual immunity  tonight  you can assign that to somebody  else or keep it for yourself   keeping it   probst sugar is safe  tonight  everybody else is fair game  it is time to vote  ace youre up   youre one of the snakes and  i got to get rid of you  go home   crystal ive been waiting  for this day for so long and i  am so happy its here   probst ill go tally the  votes  if anybody has the hidden  immunity idol and you want to  play it now would be the time  to do so  okay once the votes are read  the decision is final  the person voted out will be  asked to leave the tribal  council area immediately  ill read the votes  first vote ace  crystal  one vote ace one vote crystal  ace  two votes ace one vote crystal  were tied  two votes crystal two votes  ace one vote left  seventh person voted out of  isurvivor gaboni  ace thats three  you need to bring me your torch   probst ace the tribe has  spoken   good luck guys   probst well based on the  reaction from ace id say that  was a blindside   days in fang is finally  starting to play this game  grab your torches  head back to camp  good night  dont go away  coming up next kota prepares  for their own tribal council   right now would be an  optimal time to get me out   probst while dan digs his  own grave  susie commits social suicide   i was actually going to vote  you   really  i hate her  i want her gone yesterday   can i ask you a question   what   im not going tonight am i   not that i know of  given the fact that everyones  voting for susie   it has to be susie cause  we have no idea  we could stay together as a  tribe for another two rounds  right now would be an optimal  time to get me out as a strong  player so this is a huge vote  for me because im either going  to come back here and trust  everyone or im going to be at  home eating a pizza   please trust us   yeah   and you know   andand that is incredible  faith on my part but i know i  got to do it   randys replaced bob in a  final four situation because i  think randys willing to cast  his lot in with a good group of  people and hes found that  and he you know as long as he  keeps his end of the bargain  hes got a great run for this  game   she knows shes low man on  the totem pole  shes bound to  she may continue to dig her  grave all day long andand  yalls conclusion may shift   of course   as annoying as bob is i see  him as being as loyal and  trustworthy as the day is long   andand right now i cant  say the same thing about dan   i cant either   but im closer being able to  say it about susie than i am  about dan   dan is super vulnerable  tonight  and the only thing dan has going  for him right now is that he  should really cross his fingers  that susies going to blow up  and do some crazy stuff   i really like you and i  dont want you to go home  so im not writing your name  down and i just wanted you to  know that  youre just not on my list of   do you know whowho theyre  thinking about voting out   um i think that its going  to be dan   thats what your your guess  is its gonna be dan   i think so yeah  but we felt like we dont want  to take somebody thats gonna  flip  i feel really good about the  fact that you wouldnt   no i wouldnt as long as  you keep me in the loop  ii figured people were talking  and i figured eventually they  would come to me and tell me  where im at you know  cause i when i was gonna  okay im gonna be honest with  you  i was actually going to vote  you because   why   because i know that im a  hard worker  ii know that without having  fire and water and food how are  you going to perform physically  youre going to have to take  that time to do that work   mmhmm   so im just being totally up  front with you so and  thats the truth   okay so you need me to help  more   well yeah i need help from  everybody actually  so thats where im at  but ii appreciate that cause  now i know which way i can  swing   so this moron has decided  that shed like me to go  really  i hate her  i hate her hate her hate her  like i really want to stab her  in the face  and if you piss me off youve  pissed off my alliance   did i not say to you guys  shes nuts  i mean certifiable   but shes the worst kind of  nuts cause you dont see it  coming   she goes whichever way the  wind is blowing   um i mean i hate her  i want her gone yesterday   susies game is no game  and the problem with no game is  her vote can be bought  shes gone   tonight i dont want any  sort of curveball  i do not want to go home  tonight  i dont know what could be  cooking  i mean dan doesnt have the  idol does he   not that i know of   what if susie and dan get  together dan has the idol  and hes like lets both  vote corinne   then youre gone   lets just take her out  then she has to go   everybodys ass is on the  line  susie needs to go  shes annoying  i want her to go home and soon   so um heres the thing  my entire plan was wedged on the  fact that susie is easy she  trusts us and shes never  gonna win individual immunity  we can get rid of her when we  want  i didnt realize she wasi locoi  ien la cabezai  like i had no idea that that  was what i was dealing with   i am devastated right now   well im completely  frustrated because i feel like  we got some issues that we had  no idea existed   what do you think is the  safer bet  cause im really a little  concerned   were at the point where  i think either decision has  incredible risks associated  with it   right   thank god we have a  twoperson advantage at this  point  but dan could have the  immunity idol  but i really doubt it so  if he actually does have the  immunity idol we should vote  out susie   yeah   just in case theres an idol   yeah  were worried that dan has the  immunity idol because he spent  a couple days on exile island  but we also think that dan may  need to go  so unfortunately its not who  is the best asset  its who is the least risky  which stinks because you know  we still dont know who were  gonna be better off with   probst marcus is the game  at a point where youre now  looking out for yourself versus  keeping our tribe strong   i think were basing our  decision on what were  expecting to come in the next  few days  weve got to surround ourselves  with the most powerful crowd of  people because thats the only  way were going to survive an  onslaught from the rest of the  fang tribe   probst susie looking at  this tribe you got to be a  little concerned yourself  is it fair to say that youre  the weakest person on this  tribe in challenges   ii dont think i am  i think theres certain skills  that i may be a little bit  weaker at but   probst whos weaker than  you on this tribe   um i think strengthwise  upper strength i think im  stronger than corinne   probst corinne not buying  that at all   i dont want to insult her  i think that she is very  skilled and i think that she  does have athletic talent you  know   probst she just insulted  you   well yes and thats why im  telling you that i dont agree  i think that i have a lot to  offer  i think i have upper body  strength  i think ive got a lot of  things but   and you probably do  i dont i mean im just im  trying to just kind of observe  and just kind of see where this  games taking me and   probst corinne have you  picked up on susies tendencies  to maybe sometimes let loose   yeah but ive operated  without a filter for so many  years that like i totally  respect when people come out of  their shell and just say  whatever it is that theyre  thinking  i mean i would encourage more  of that  maybe you should blow up once  in a while and then ill know  you better   probst randy where do you  sit on the be yourself versus  hold it in   im probably about eight on a  scale of ten and thats good  and bad   probst whats good about it   i dont have to pretend  and uh you know people pretty  much know where i stand most of  the time   probst whats bad about it   i dont have to pretend and  people know where i stand most  of the time  laughter   probst dan where do you fit  in on that   um i tend to be a  worrywart and so it has  inhibited me from being  completely comfortable and  completely myself  but my result in the game will  fare much better if i can shake  it off and just relax   probst charlie how big a  factor is trust becoming   days in for this group of  seven   its huge because we intend  to go into a merge as a  powerful group together  and if someone splinters our  numbers will dwindle before the  fang numbers dwindle  so my vote is based on who i can  trust going into a merge most   probst corinne is it  possible that tonights vote  could be a mistake   damn yeah  i dont know if were making  the right decision or if i  personally am making the right  decision  i hope that i am   probst all right lets get  to the vote  marcus thanks to a nice  performance today you have  individual immunity  it is yours unless you choose  to give it to somebody else   we won it for kota but im  going to hang on to this one   probst all right you cannot  vote for marcus  everybody else is fair game  it is time to vote  bob youre up   dan  sorry guy   susie you have a uh a  great heart and im going to  vote with what i think the rest  of the tribe is voting   this is about dan not you   probst ill go tally the  votes  if anybody has the hidden  immunity idol and you want to  play it now would be the time  to do so  okay once the votes are read  the decision is final  person voted out will be  asked to leave the tribal  council area immediately  ill read the votes  first vote susie  dan  dan  two votes dan one vote susie  susie  were tied two votes susie  two votes dan  dan  three votes dan two votes  susie  susie  were tied three votes susie  three votes dan  one

kid thats seeking approval it different than fang where i alienated myself because i didnt like those people with you guy it completely opposite it like all right i really like these three dan is the

screwing me around probst come on in guy well now bring in sugar returning from exile island probst all right you guy ready to get to today immunity challenge yeah probst first thing first dan i will take it back thank you good news and bad news about today challenge bad news is both tribe are going to tribal council tonight both tribe are gonna vote somebody out the good news each of you will have an equal shot at winning individual immunity it a log roll youre gonna match up against another tribe member it might be somebody from the other tribe it might be somebody from your own tribe your goal is to stay on the log longer than the other person first person to hit the water is out winner move on last person left standing win immunity and is safe at tonight tribal council i think i may have a target on my back so it very very important for me personally to go in there and win and not just win by a little win by a lot probst in addition there is a twist which will be revealed after the challenge is over another twist probst well draw number get our matchup well get started all right first matchup dan taking on ace all right here we go put a foot on the log three two one walk we are on first matchup good footwork dan is in the water ace move on to the next round next round charlie versus crystal this challenge is on charlie and crystal looking to move on crystal in the water first charlie moving on to the next round big matchup marcus versus matty good save by marcus mattys in the water marcus moving on to the next round randy taking on susie both from the kota tribe nice footwork ah susie in the water first randy moving on to the next round kenny versus sugar two fang member this dumb thing laugh i cant even move this probst can he fight to hang on no kenny in the water first sugar moving on last of the first round bob and corinne of course he did laughter probst who knew that would come in handy here we go bob versus corinne bob the former log roll winner three two one walk bob whistling sugar laughing corinne in the water first bob moving on all right semifinal round we have our matchup charlie taking on ace go come on charlie probst the winner move on to the final round ace staying alive charlies got him on the run great match ace on the run can he recover charlies in the water first ace moving on to the final very close now it is marcus taking on randy one of you will move on to the final round come on randy probst randy on the run randy in the water first marcus moving on to the final round all right next round sugar versus bob were on winner move on to the final round to join ace and marcus great match sugar not going anywhere bob slip trying to hang on bob is back up a great recovery sugar scream bob in the water first sugar moving on congratulation probst the log rolling champion hit the water first youll be ridiculed back home laughter for the final round all three of you will be on the log at the same time groaning take your spot for the final round ace we drew for spot you got the middle you guy put a foot on the log hold it steady you know i feel this win is enormous so it important that i win this challenge if i can pull it off ill be proud of myself if not ill probably shoot myself in the pinky toe probst the challenge is on three people on the log at once the last person on the log win immunity good footwork by all three sugar with a nice save another nice save by marcus sugar on the run another nice save everybody still alive sugar in the water first it ace and marcus fighting for immunity great battle ace in the water first marcus win individual immunity whoo probst congratulation applause marcus safe at tonight tribal council now to the twist this is yours to read read it out loud so everybody can hear it you will now assign immunity to one member of the other tribe im going to give this to sugar probst sugar come on over applause my hope is that sugar is smart enough to keep the immunity idol to herself and that might actually end up giving u one of our biggest surprise which would be losing a big power player from the fang tribe in ace matty or crystal probst sugar safe at tonight tribal council for fang marcus is safe for kota when i saw sugar with the immunity necklace around her neck im like damn this girl ha two idol she is now the most powerful person in this game who would you have picked from the other tribe to give immunity to i dont know you dont know maybe susie susie yeah yeah you think susies gonna be gone tonight i think thats irritating people oh matty and ace theyre thinking to get rid of crystal and it all depends on the pinup girl sugar so yeah i will lie in this game i will do everything in my power to get her to vote with me because my life and crystal life rest upon her so basically this is honest to god truth this is whats happening around camp im not lying to you matty go were voting out sugar next immunity challenge and then crystal like okay so then when crystal went away i looked at ace im like are we really voting out sugar and ace is like right now sugar is really good for nothing except for the hidden immunity idol they think youre like clueless youre like a dumb blonde or whatever okay and ace think he ha you wrapped around his finger okay i dont trust kenny he might have been lying to me but i have been trusting the biggest snake in the game so far and ive known that so i really dont know who to trust at any point in this game ace is like well i actually got the hidden immunity idol from her once i can probably do that and then we can blindside her and then ill have the hidden immunity idol and i wa like oh my freaking god this guy is a snake you and i will say were voting on crystal we blindside ace blindside ace today and we dont have to worry about the snake ever again never again i trust sugar and i trust that she will go along with the plan to vote out ace she may be the pinup girl but shes very smart kenny ha reassured me all is well i will truly believe sugar when she writes ace name down either shes going to write my name or shes going to write ace name why who going to do that theyd only have two vote mattys with you theyd have three vote no itd be kenny and crystal wouldnt it i gave it back to you last time ill give it back to you this time oh ace i gotta think about it okay thats fine you make me feel awful when ace asked me for the idol it made me think maybe kenny wa telling me the truth dont you think after ace definitely know how to finagle people much more than ive ever seen anybody do probably in my life but he definitely had my back ill bring the last of it and then thats it all right go for it crystal supposed to go next but plan could change ace could be turning on me now i have no idea oh god what am i gonna do with this thing probst sugar youve been out here day tell me about camp life whats going on um we are very low on rice crystal accidentally knocked some over and she didnt eat because she knocked it over probst kenny how much rice did you have before crystal knocked it over we had about seven day worth crystal ended up scooping some of the rice that she spilled outside back into the pot so probably had about five and a half day worth of rice probst so matty the rice is so valuable that if you spill even a little in the dirt you gotta pick it out grain by grain the rice is valuable it the most valuable thing we have we get about six to eight spoonful a day of rice probst wow and she spill the rice and nobody go god crystal what are you doing nobody no but your face said it all just simmer down your face said it all my face say it all nobody say a word to her because they knew it wa an accident exactly so just i didnt purposely go over to the rice box and just throw the rice down just let me get to my point can i get to my point get to your point and then ill talk so then we looked past it we moved past that issue probst ace make sense of that for me crystal made a mistake thats common the whole part of u feeling angry at her i thought wa a bit concocted in her own head now im delusional i can see it on your face ace okay dont look at me like that when matty turned around he wa like oh whatever then he made some look at you ace i didnt say anything to anybody i just sat down there picking up about grain of rice and then they started to eat oh crystal come on and eat no i spilled some of the rice so i will go without and thats what i did and thats why i did it nobody asked you to crystal it not like you saved me any anyways you still ate it i asked you three time yeah i mean if you cared enough you wouldve saved me some anyways probst sugar you have like the perfect seat in the midst of this great shakespearean drama i know probst your eye are like saucer this sound like such petty bull crap to me i mean i think that we can get past our issue better than this and this is why we havent been winning because people are holding these stupid petty thing against each other probst all right sugar you have individual immunity tonight you can assign that to somebody else or keep it for yourself keeping it probst sugar is safe tonight everybody else is fair game it is time to vote ace youre up youre one of the snake and i got to get rid of you go home crystal ive been waiting for this day for so long and i am so happy it here probst ill go tally the vote if anybody ha the hidden immunity idol and you want to play it now would be the time to do so okay once the vote are read the decision is final the person voted out will be asked to leave the tribal council area immediately ill read the vote first vote ace crystal one vote ace one vote crystal ace two vote ace one vote crystal were tied two vote crystal two vote ace one vote left seventh person voted out of isurvivor gaboni ace thats three you need to bring me your torch probst ace the tribe ha spoken good luck guy probst well based on the reaction from ace id say that wa a blindside day in fang is finally starting to play this game grab your torch head back to camp good night dont go away coming up next kota prepares for their own tribal council right now would be an optimal time to get me out probst while dan dig his own grave susie commits social suicide i wa actually going to vote you really i hate her i want her gone yesterday can i ask you a question what im not going tonight am i not that i know of given the fact that everyones voting for susie it ha to be susie cause we have no idea we could stay together a a tribe for another two round right now would be an optimal time to get me out a a strong player so this is a huge vote for me because im either going to come back here and trust everyone or im going to be at home eating a pizza please trust u yeah and you know andand that is incredible faith on my part but i know i got to do it randys replaced bob in a final four situation because i think randys willing to cast his lot in with a good group of people and he found that and he you know a long a he keep his end of the bargain he got a great run for this game she know shes low man on the totem pole shes bound to she may continue to dig her grave all day long andand yalls conclusion may shift of course a annoying a bob is i see him a being a loyal and trustworthy a the day is long andand right now i cant say the same thing about dan i cant either but im closer being able to say it about susie than i am about dan dan is super vulnerable tonight and the only thing dan ha going for him right now is that he should really cross his finger that susies going to blow up and do some crazy stuff i really like you and i dont want you to go home so im not writing your name down and i just wanted you to know that youre just not on my list of do you know whowho theyre thinking about voting out um i think that it going to be dan thats what your your guess is it gonna be dan i think so yeah but we felt like we dont want to take somebody thats gonna flip i feel really good about the fact that you wouldnt no i wouldnt a long a you keep me in the loop ii figured people were talking and i figured eventually they would come to me and tell me where im at you know cause i when i wa gonna okay im gonna be honest with you i wa actually going to vote you because why because i know that im a hard worker ii know that without having fire and water and food how are you going to perform physically youre going to have to take that time to do that work mmhmm so im just being totally up front with you so and thats the truth okay so you need me to help more well yeah i need help from everybody actually so thats where im at but ii appreciate that cause now i know which way i can swing so this moron ha decided that shed like me to go really i hate her i hate her hate her hate her like i really want to stab her in the face and if you piss me off youve pissed off my alliance did i not say to you guy shes nut i mean certifiable but shes the worst kind of nut cause you dont see it coming she go whichever way the wind is blowing um i mean i hate her i want her gone yesterday susies game is no game and the problem with no game is her vote can be bought shes gone tonight i dont want any sort of curveball i do not want to go home tonight i dont know what could be cooking i mean dan doesnt have the idol doe he not that i know of what if susie and dan get together dan ha the idol and he like let both vote corinne then youre gone let just take her out then she ha to go everybodys as is on the line susie need to go shes annoying i want her to go home and soon so um here the thing my entire plan wa wedged on the fact that susie is easy she trust u and shes never gonna win individual immunity we can get rid of her when we want i didnt realize she wasi locoi ien la cabezai like i had no idea that that wa what i wa dealing with i am devastated right now well im completely frustrated because i feel like we got some issue that we had no idea existed what do you think is the safer bet cause im really a little concerned were at the point where i think either decision ha incredible risk associated with it right thank god we have a twoperson advantage at this point but dan could have the immunity idol but i really doubt it so if he actually doe have the immunity idol we should vote out susie yeah just in case there an idol yeah were worried that dan ha the immunity idol because he spent a couple day on exile island but we also think that dan may need to go so unfortunately it not who is the best asset it who is the least risky which stink because you know we still dont know who were gonna be better off with probst marcus is the game at a point where youre now looking out for yourself versus keeping our tribe strong i think were basing our decision on what were expecting to come in the next few day weve got to surround ourselves with the most powerful crowd of people because thats the only way were going to survive an onslaught from the rest of the fang tribe probst susie looking at this tribe you got to be a little concerned yourself is it fair to say that youre the weakest person on this tribe in challenge ii dont think i am i think there certain skill that i may be a little bit weaker at but probst who weaker than you on this tribe um i think strengthwise upper strength i think im stronger than corinne probst corinne not buying that at all i dont want to insult her i think that she is very skilled and i think that she doe have athletic talent you know probst she just insulted you well yes and thats why im telling you that i dont agree i think that i have a lot to offer i think i have upper body strength i think ive got a lot of thing but and you probably do i dont i mean im just im trying to just kind of observe and just kind of see where this game taking me and probst corinne have you picked up on susies tendency to maybe sometimes let loose yeah but ive operated without a filter for so many year that like i totally respect when people come out of their shell and just say whatever it is that theyre thinking i mean i would encourage more of that maybe you should blow up once in a while and then ill know you better probst randy where do you sit on the be yourself versus hold it in im probably about eight on a scale of ten and thats good and bad probst whats good about it i dont have to pretend and uh you know people pretty much know where i stand most of the time probst whats bad about it i dont have to pretend and people know where i stand most of the time laughter probst dan where do you fit in on that um i tend to be a worrywart and so it ha inhibited me from being completely comfortable and completely myself but my result in the game will fare much better if i can shake it off and just relax probst charlie how big a factor is trust becoming day in for this group of seven it huge because we intend to go into a merge a a powerful group together and if someone splinter our number will dwindle before the fang number dwindle so my vote is based on who i can trust going into a merge most probst corinne is it possible that tonight vote could be a mistake damn yeah i dont know if were making the right decision or if i personally am making the right decision i hope that i am probst all right let get to the vote marcus thanks to a nice performance today you have individual immunity it is yours unless you choose to give it to somebody else we won it for kota but im going to hang on to this one probst all right you cannot vote for marcus everybody else is fair game it is time to vote bob youre up dan sorry guy susie you have a uh a great heart and im going to vote with what i think the rest of the tribe is voting this is about dan not you probst ill go tally the vote if anybody ha the hidden immunity idol and you want to play it now would be the time to do so okay once the vote are read the decision is final person voted out will be asked to leave the tribal council area immediately ill read the vote first vote susie dan dan two vote dan one vote susie susie were tied two

main character is a cherry boy his female teacher seduces him at first  soon they start to indulge themselves in sampm play  wow  how do you come up with the storyline  i have several basic storylines  mothersinlaw teachers office ladies i pick a topic  there is also sampm play  the readers really enjoy my precise details  so i have the tendency to describe more in detail  i really enjoyed reading the novel called the burst of love  it was hardcore but also elegant  i was absorbed into the story when i wrote it  especially the description of the bondage was superb  ive collected data to study that  i also interviewed an expert in bondage  theres a lot of effort to write a book  i was embarrassed when i was called an authentic sampm novelist  kept thinking what if sampm fanatics read my novel  my story is based on my imagination  who knows you must have a lot of experience  i dont   of my stories are based on my imagination  well lets get started now  okay  ithe other  isi  ino way i wonder if he actually likes sampm playi  uehara look at this  im burning up  on the teachers podium  the hot vaginal secretions were oozing out  from misakos lustful body  takeshi couldnt believe the

thing we need is for any more salacious details to get out  but it happens  im sorry  im presuming it was just the one time  yes  ruth well melanie is brutal but straight  so any footage they have of you and mrs hansen  we ask for it to be delivered up so it can be destroyed  it doesnt serve her client to be exposed as spying on his wife  no it points to a predilection for voyeurism   of which we know he has form zander agreed  but more than that it compounds the coercive behavior  i mean abusive behavior  hannah were currently trying to iron out the child arrangement situation  and he is not making it easy for us  i suspect hes leaking stories to the press to shows his wife in a bad light  sighs  its a mess  ruth well we can clean it up as elegantly as we can  there are enough stories circulating around him to surely   push back a little  yeah  hannah but none of them are making the press  we need to find the women who are willing to talk  offer legal protection to break their ndas  after the way the press annihilated the nanny  no ones willing to come out and say who richie hansen is  either way you cant be on this case anymore  agreed ruths going to take it over with hannah from here  zander  youve compromised yourself christie  you know how vulnerable she is   shes a grown woman  and you took advantage of that  so were done here  hey  just wondered if youd look over the hansen position statement  i changed a little of the wording  change it back  sorry  i just i thought it was a little clumsy  ive been doing this  years dont be clever  clarity over finesse  oh sorry sorry rewind  last para you were right cuts are great  nathan it turns out richie hansen planted cameras in the family home  hes bugging his wife  yeah well it happens  er weve gone in hard with his lawyers and threatened civil proceedings  i mean i i dont know if there would have been much on it  but its one way to keep track of your spouse  its the use of incriminating there must be something  nhd would have noted it as such  if there wasnt something worth shutting down  ill find out more  just for claritys sake  itouchi  nathan  ive left hannah   ok  it surprisingly is  really its been coming for a while im fine   where are you gonna stay  um  last night my sisterinlaws  but er probably best to draw territory lines away from family so   yeah  hotel   you can always  er no no no im fine  im a grownup single white male we know how to do these things  credit card toothbrush takeaway we travel light  just to clarify i wasnt asking you if you wanted to stay over  theres a noticeboard for flat rentals in the chambers bar  and as the yoot of today would say i can highly recommend spare room  yeah rub it in why dont you  im sorry  i am too  nathan but its not over till the fat lady sings   youve lost me now  fat lady   fat lady sings  no  its a turn of phrase fat lady fat lady sings  nathan oh get out of here with your bloody spare room and your airbnb  oh airbnb radical  hannah i know that youre angry your message was certainly clear  not only is it a massive infringement of my clients privacy  to knowingly record or film without permission  but you dont need me to also remind you that if you try and use any evidence  as leverage at the forthcoming child arrangements hearings  any judge will recognize it as unscrupulous  especially as it includes recordings of his own children at home and play  but you have to admit what it threw up was pretty titillating  melanie also its a little bit embarrassing for your colleague  with regards to my client i have to admit that i dont approve hannah  and were not going to be using it  but it doesnt put fi hansen in a very good light  clear examples of drugtaking compounded with a rather racy threeway  already in the public domain  i mean it asks questions  whether she has the ability to be able to focus on her children  fi hansen has not got a drug problem  i mean either way it wont play well with the judge  your client is orchestrating all this to his advantage  but the press can turn melanie  and they will turn quick given the right information  threats hannah  chuckles that is not your style  but you might want to be careful because mr hansen  is a little volatile right now because his children are everything  but your client failed to take his children to school this morning  we have both been in this business for long enough  to know that the likes of mr hansen  have a shroud of wealth and a retinue willing to cover up  and serve them  exactly so therell be a new show the next project  which no one will want to jeopardize a week from now  no melanie   thats the past  but is it  it is amazing what a couple of hundred grand wont do  to shut those girls up  oh anyway ive said it before those russian and tech billionaires  are just so much easier  we want all the footage  and well be making an application within these proceedings  for delivery up of all recordings  and to prohibit your client from using any of it  dramatic music playing  no audio  music continues playing  sighs   hey  hi  mr pope  not to put too fine a point on it hannah but a baby   my baby  right welcome home  not exactly not entirely sarahs gone ballistic  nice tan  how was la   amazing  nina your mess  youre pregnant  hello to you too  youre pregnant  yippitydoo  and its definitely mine  or the guy from uber eats who knows  yes you dick unfortunately its yours read the letter  should you even be carrying that  it was just a courtesy but if youd like a dna test  yeah i would  a legal letter  well what did you expect im a lawyer  i made it as easy as i could to read  and you dont want anything  er  no thanks youve done your job  so thats what it was  oh dont flatter yourself no it was three mojitos  and a good gag about your old headmaster that swung it  thanks ive kept that one in  and then you went back to your exwife  how is that going  that by which you mean sarah  the weather helps  oh congratulations by the way  your show   do you like it  no its pretty shit  sarahs not happy  you chose to go back to her  to be frank we might not stay  its tanked your shows tanked  thats not the point  god you do this you throw me off my point which is  a baby  yeah thats what im hoping well get at the end of this   wow  sighs its fine   its not fine  well its happening  ive got my scan tomorrow  ive got a gig in toronto  i could maybe push the flight back a few hours  i wasnt inviting you  i wanna be there  we need to talk dinner just please give me a few hours tonight  ive missed you  hey  eh  rex tyler  youre on that netflix thing my nephew loves it  how olds your nephew  er   fi stay calm  how long will the press run with this im everywhere  hes going to take my kids  the press are inferring at best that im a party girl   fi  hes going to capitalize on this  when he wants something he gets it   and he wants my kids  hes not going to get your kids  ruth is my colleague  shell be working with me now that christie has left the team   mrs hansen  bullshit bullshit  fi is this what you do  lure women like me into thinking they stand a chance  no  have you any idea what its like looking at your life ripped apart  exposed to the fact that your whole life has been a lie  can you imagine your life without your kids  fi no cos you dont have to youre not where im at  mrs hansen youre not going to lose your kids because he is not going to win  ruth because you are a good mother  because you have safely brought up three children so far  i presume theyre all at school today   yes  yes so look  anything that any newspaper says  is just the grease that turns the wheels of another press day  ruth so you breathe  you leave us to prepare your case and you trust in your lawyer  because she is good she is very good  sighs  hannah fi  we need to find women willing to go on record against your husband  push back that bad press where it belongs  have you spoken to ali  shes leaving  fi she texted me this morning i dont think richie knows yet  ah every time  ali   do we have a meeting booked in  no  youre leaving  yeah im terminating my interests   i really shouldnt be talking to you  then why did you leak the tape   like legally i cant talk to you  you signed an nda   cant  which you can break  yeah right  we will support you   look nhd can help you  help me how  you leaked the tape ali youre halfway there  and before call it calculated denial now  its out there  and like it or not the covers blown we can guide you  i started working for richie straight out of college  my entire career is based around that man  he actually wasnt born an arsehole its just people like me  make people like him feel that its all right to be one  i have spent the last decade cleaning up and sanitizing that mans life  thats what we do   and if i break that trust its  what what the sky will fall  i know youve been approached by the press   half of them are my mates  then talk to them  therere a million richies  we book every appointment  we bail them out with vit b shots and rehab  ali we buy presents for their kids  we prop them up on the red

and susie   i dont have the confidence  that we get to the merge and  these people have got my back   probst throughout the game  the red tribe fang  consistently made questionable  moves   im stuck in a tribe that has  no skills   probst ace made a headsup  play   thats the deal   deal   deal   probst when he pulled  matty into an alliance with his  longtime ally sugar   ive been relying on ace the  whole time   one of sugars biggest  plusses is the fact that she has  the immunity idol  and ive got sugar in my pocket   probst their first move was  to vote out aces biggest enemy  kelly  kelly the tribe has spoken   are left  who will be voted out tonight     animals chirping chittering  animal squawks in distance   this is a tough game  were starving   theres nothing to eat  im starting to lose my spirit  im starting to lose my hope  itsits become hopeless  im hopeless about fang   what happened   as soon as i got up it  tipped over  but just a little bit came out  but ill scoop it back in there  cause it it was just a  little bit   thats a ton  rice is more valuable than gold  and she just clumsily trips over  it and spills it  i wanted to just lay into her  and chew her out but i its  just pointless  you cant cry over spilled  milk you know  its just too late  is it done   yeah not so bad   you guys ready   nothing like some fresh  oatmeal rice   i dont want to take away  from you and matty   crystal eat   ace you eat   come on please   you dont have to beg me  you eat  i dont want to feel like i took  away from anybody in this tribe  so by all means eat your full  like you normally do   this tribe fang tribe were  not working together  everybody has grudges against  each other  matty and ace are basically  going against crystal  these guys are trying to call  the shots and i dont like  that i dont like that at all   you guys donti havei to say  anything but your faces say a  thousand words  thats the difference between me  and you guys   crystal did me a favor  she will be the next lamb to the  slaughter  captioning sponsored by  cbs paramount  network television  theme song playing     animal bellows    wwwopensubtitlesorg     my parents are like  corinne try not to curse so  much when youre there because  people are gonna think youre  trashy  laughter   i think charlie and marcus  and corinne seem very very  tight and at times almost  exclusive  and im just the type of person  that im always gonna feel a  little bit vulnerable a little  bit insecure  i mean i wanted to clarify that  im like a really sensitive  person   yeah   and its weird when im not  part of a group  i kind of like itit like  makes me feel bad a little bit  thats just me like thats how  i am with groups   yeah yeah   you know i like to be part  of the group   i would say that dan is  socially inept in a lot of ways  i dont know if hes a former  fatty or why he wasnt liked as  a child but deep down inside  hes a little kid thats seeking  approval   its different than fang  where i alienated myself because  i didnt like those people  with you guys its completely  opposite  its like all right i really  like these three   dan is the ultimate paranoid  human being  at some point dan is gonna be a  huge liability and  unfortunately theres nothing i  can do toto sort of save him  fromfrom himself at this point   do you feel better   yeah i do   okay   do you guys   yeah   all right good      probst come on in guys  kota getting your first look at  the new fang tribe  kelly voted out at the last  tribal council  all right you guys ready to get  to todays challenge

doing  nothing absolutely nothing   come on sugar   probst sugars gonna have to  get aggressive try to make  something happen  bob almost deflects it  no another takedown by bob on  matty   laughing   come on sugar   probst ace tries to get it  past bob but bob shuts him  down  kota scores again  kota leads twozip  we are playing to three  this could be it  next round attacking for kota  is dan  he could end this challenge  attacking for fang is matty  trying to keep fang alive for a  big reward  survivors ready  go  matty comes out strong chasing  after that ball quickly  dan very aggressive on ace  ace gets rid of it to crystal  crystal to sugar back to ace  ace back to sugar no  dan causes the ball to break  kota scores  kota wins reward  excited chatter  all right kota big decision  youre sending one member of  fang to exile island   lets go ahead and send  sugar   probst sugar this is  unprecedented  i dont think weve ever had  anybody be sent to exile five  times backtobacktoback  tobacktoback   yeah im here to break  records you know laughs   probst all right sugar get  your stuff   sugar is a pinup model  she is completely worthless when  it comes to challenges  so when it comes to sugar in  this game i would really  really really desire her to go   probst kota it should be a  fun afternoon  indistinct chatter  fang i got nothing for you   we lost the biggest reward  yet  its hard you know when you  see them walking away  they have everything and we  have nothing  and we see kota in their  beautiful chopper just lavishing  in their reward you know  its madness its total  madness      reward was a helicopter ride  and i was lucky enough to have  ithei frontrow seat  just seeing that incredible  crater it made my trip to  africa  the only thing that was beating  faster than the rotors on that  helicopter was the beating of my  heart   oh wow   close as i want to get   holy cow   stay away from the edge   youre making me nervous  marcus  the beautiful scenery it was  awesome  its something i thought i would  never experience so it just  gives you more incentive more  power more strength to know  that you can get through this  no matter what  so it was very it was very  surreal for me  it was just amazing   lets get our blanket out   this is great lets get our  blanket out   sardines haha   i dont think in  my entire  years of living  ive ever been so embarrassed  im humiliated i felt pathetic  my spirits are dropping so fast  i look over and like sugar  shes just she cant do  anything  shes just being dominated  it was pointless for us to even  keep going  she was just standing there  getting walked all over  i hate it  im starting to get pissed  as long as theres physical  challenges were gonna lose  want to take a boat ride ace   sure bro   we need to take out sugar  okay this is what we do  we go kenny crystal and i vote  for sugar  you dont have to vote for  sugar so youre not  backstabbing her okay  sugars gone and its you and i  to the merge a hundred percent  theres no question   you know were a hundred  percent you and me   no i dont know that  were aligned  me and you are aligned so make  me comfortable  we need to take out sugar or at  least get the idol out   yeah i see the logic dude  i see that logic   okay we know exactly where  its sitting and we can use it  to our advantage when we have  to   you know what theyre  talking about right cri   yeah those two asses out  there in the boat trying to get  me off   they are will you trust me   ive been there with you  from day one kenny   we have to blindside ace   yeah   i have to talk to sugar  crystal you trust me a  hundred percent right   i trust you a hundred  percent   okay   i can feel ace right now  strategically wants to get rid  of me  the way that hes manipulating  matty hes a devil  and he has to go   this is this is awesome   getting this is just  incomparable   and the best part about this  is they dont get it   and they may be completely  out of rice to add insult to  injury   oh oh   what is this   oh my   oh my god   wait stop everyone shh   holy cow these are letters  from home   oh my god theyre letters  oh my god oh my god  gasps  oh my god  theyre really letters   sobbing   bob are you okay man   no im not   your family loves you bob   i know it sobbing  grunts  i dont know which one to read  first  this is from david   my dad he never writes  anything and he wrote me a  letter   isnt that cool   he never writes anything  he wasnt even excited  he didnt show any excitement  when i was leaving  wow   you should receive  i cant read it  my eyes keep blurring  im close to these people here  but these are the people that  are the closest to my heart  life is good  and i realize how lucky a man i  am  im here  and i cant  i cant wait to get home to  them  life doesnt get better than  this   back to the sugar shack  for me  i dont really know what the  hells happening in this game  im just  trying to survive laughs  thank god for ace  whats funny is im pretty sure  were using each other but i  feel like my tribe thinks im  naive and that im sticking  with him out of stupidity but  im sticking with him because  hes the strongest player at  this point  so i just hope that theyre not  all screwing me around   probst come on in guys  well now bring in sugar  returning from exile island   probst all right you guys  ready to get to todays  immunity challenge   yeah   probst first things first  dan i will take it back  thank you  good news and bad news about  todays challenge  bad news is both tribes are  going to tribal council tonight  both tribes are gonna vote  somebody out  the good news each of you will  have an equal shot at winning  individual immunity  its a log roll  youre gonna match up  against another tribe member  it might be somebody from the  other tribe  it might be somebody from your  own tribe  your goal is to stay on the log  longer than the other person  first person to hit the water  is out  winners move on  last person left standing wins  immunity and is safe at  tonights tribal council   i think i may have a target  on my back so its very very  important for me personally to  go in there and win and not  just win by a little  win by a lot   probst in addition there is  a twist which will be revealed  after the challenge is over   another twist   probst well draw numbers  get our matchups well get  started  all right first matchup dan  taking on ace  all right here we go  put a foot on the log  three two one walk  we are on first matchup  good footwork  dan is in the water  ace moves on to the next round  next round charlie versus  crystal  this challenge is on  charlie and crystal looking to  move on  crystal in the water first  charlie moving on to the next  round  big matchup marcus versus  matty  good save by marcus  mattys in the water  marcus moving on to the next  round  randy taking on susie  both from the kota tribe  nice footwork  ah susie in the water first  randy moving on to the next  round  kenny versus sugar  two fang members   this dumb thing laughs   i cant even move this   probst can he fight to hang  on  no kenny in the water first  sugar moving on  last of the first rounds bob  and corinne   of course he did  laughter   probst who knew that would  come in handy  here we go bob versus corinne  bob the former log roll winner  three two one walk  bob whistling sugar laughing  corinne in the water first  bob moving on  all right semifinal round  we have our matchups  charlie taking on ace  go   come on charlie   probst the winner moves on  to the final round  ace staying alive  charlies got him on the run  great match ace on the run  can he recover  charlies in the water first  ace moving on to the final  very close  now it is marcus taking on  randy  one of you will move on to the  final round   come on randy   probst randy on the run  randy in the water first  marcus moving on to the final  round  all right next round sugar  versus bob  were on  winner moves on to the final  round to join ace and marcus  great match  sugar not going anywhere  bob slips trying to hang on  bob is back up a great  recovery  sugar screams  bob in the water first  sugar moving on   congratulations   probst the log rolling  champion hits the water first  youll be ridiculed back home  laughter  for the final round all three  of you will be on the log at  the same time  groaning  take your spots  for the final round ace we  drew for spots you got the  middle  you guys put a foot on the log  hold it steady   you know i feel this win is  enormous so its important  that i win this challenge  if i can pull it off ill be  proud of myself  if not ill probably shoot  myself in the pinky toe   probst the challenge is on  three people on the log at once  the last person on the log wins  immunity  good footwork by all three  sugar with a nice save  another nice save by marcus  sugar on the run  another nice save  everybody still alive  sugar in the water first  its ace and marcus fighting  for immunity  great battle  ace in the water first  marcus wins individual immunity   whoo   probst congratulations  applause  marcus safe at tonights tribal  council  now to the twist this is yours  to read  read it out loud so everybody  can hear it   you will now assign immunity  to one member of the other  tribe  im going to give this to  sugar   probst sugar come on over  applause   my hope is that sugar is  smart enough to keep the  immunity idol to herself and  that might actually end up  giving us one of our biggest  surprises which would be  losing a big power player from  the fang tribe in ace matty  or crystal   probst sugar safe at  tonights tribal council for  fang  marcus is safe for kotas   when i saw sugar with the  immunity necklace around her  neck im like damn  this girl has two idols  she is now the most powerful  person in this game   who would you have picked  from the other tribe to give  immunity to   i dont know   you dont know   maybe susie   susie   yeah   yeah you think susies gonna  be gone tonight   i think thats irritating  people   oh  matty and ace theyre  thinking to get rid of crystal  and it all depends on the  pinup girl sugar  so yeah i will lie in this  game  i will do everything in my  power to get her to vote with  me because my life and crystals  life rests upon her  so basically this is honest  to god truth  this is whats happening around  camp  im not lying to you  matty goes were voting out  sugar next immunity challenge  and then crystals like okay  so then when crystal went away  i looked at ace im like  are we really voting out  sugar  and ace is like right now  sugar is really good for nothing  except for the hidden immunity  idol  they think youre like  clueless youre like a dumb  blonde or whatever  okay and ace thinks he has  you wrapped around his finger   okay  i dont trust kenny he might  have been lying to me  but i have been trusting the  biggest snake in the game so  far and ive known that  so i really dont know who to  trust at any point in this game   ace is like well i  actually got the hidden immunity  idol from her once i can  probably do that and then we can  blindside her and then ill have  the hidden immunity idol  and i was like oh my freaking  god this guy is a snake   you and i will say were  voting on crystal   we blindside ace   blindside ace today   and we dont have to worry  about the snake ever again   never again   i trust sugar and i trust  that she will go along with the  plan to vote out ace  she may be the pinup girl but  shes very smart   kenny has reassured me all is  well  i will truly believe sugar when  she writes aces name down  either shes going to write my  name or shes going to write  aces name   why  whos going to do that  theyd only have two votes  mattys with you   theyd have three votes   no itd be kenny and  crystal wouldnt it   i gave it back to you last  time  ill give it back to you this  time   oh ace i gotta think  about it okay   thats fine   you make me feel awful  when ace asked me for the idol  it made me think maybe kenny  was telling me the truth   dont you think after   ace definitely knows how to  finagle people much more than  ive ever seen anybody do  probably in my life  but hes definitely had my back   ill bring the last of it  and then thats it   all right go for it   crystals supposed to go  next but plans could change  ace could be turning on me now  i have no idea  oh god what am i gonna do with  this thing   probst sugar youve been  out here  days  tell me about camp life  whats going on   um we are very low on rice  crystal accidentally knocked  some over and she didnt eat  because she knocked it over   probst kenny how much rice  did you have before crystal  knocked it over   we had about seven days  worth  crystal ended up scooping some  of the rice that she spilled  outside back into the pot  so probably had about five and  a half days worth of rice   probst so matty the rice  is so valuable that if you  spill even a little in the dirt  you gotta pick it out grain by  grain   the rice is valuable  its the most valuable thing we  have  we get about six to eight  spoonfuls a day of rice   probst wow   and she spills the rice and  nobody goes god crystal  what are you doing nobody   no but your faces said it  all   just simmer down   your face said it all   my face says it all nobody  says a word to her   because they knew it was an  accident   exactly so just   i didnt purposely go over to  the rice box and just throw the  rice down   just let me get to my point  can i get to my point   get to your point and then  ill talk   so then we looked past it  we moved past that issue   probst ace make sense of  that for me   crystal made a mistake  thats common  the whole part of us feeling  angry at her i thought was a bit  concocted in her own head   now im delusional  i can see it on your face ace  okay dont look at me like  that  when matty turned around he was  like oh whatever  then he made some look at you  ace  i didnt say anything to  anybody  i just sat down there picking up  about  grains of rice  and then they started to eat  oh crystal come on and eat  no i spilled some of the rice  so i will go without and  thats what i did and thats  why i did it   nobody asked you to crystal   its not like you saved me  any anyways you still ate it   i asked you three times   yeah i mean if you cared  enough you wouldve saved me  some anyways   probst sugar you have  like the perfect seat in the  midst of this great  shakespearean drama   i know   probst your eyes are like  saucers   this sounds like such petty  bull crap to me  i mean i think that we can get  past our issues better than  this and this is why we havent  been winning because people are  holding these stupid petty  things against each other   probst all right sugar you  have individual immunity  tonight  you can assign that to somebody  else or keep it for yourself   keeping it   probst sugar is safe  tonight  everybody else is fair game  it is time to vote  ace youre up   youre one of the snakes and  i got to get rid of you  go home   crystal ive been waiting  for this day for so long and i  am so happy its here   probst ill go tally the  votes  if anybody has the hidden  immunity idol and you want to  play it now would be the time  to do so  okay once the votes are read  the decision is final  the person voted out will be  asked to leave the tribal  council area immediately  ill read the votes  first vote ace  crystal  one vote ace one vote crystal  ace  two votes ace one vote crystal  were tied  two votes crystal two votes  ace one vote left  seventh person voted out of  isurvivor gaboni  ace thats three  you need to bring me your torch   probst ace the tribe has  spoken   good luck guys   probst well based on the  reaction from ace id say that  was a blindside   days in fang is finally  starting to play this game  grab your torches  head back to camp  good night  dont go away  coming up next kota prepares  for their own tribal council   right now would be an  optimal time to get me out   probst while dan digs his  own grave  susie commits social suicide   i was actually going to vote  you   really  i hate her  i want her gone yesterday   can i ask you a question   what   im not going tonight am i   not that i know of  given the fact that everyones  voting for susie   it has to be susie cause  we have no idea  we could stay together as a  tribe for another two rounds  right now would be an optimal  time to get me out as a strong  player so this is a huge vote  for me because im either going  to come back here and trust  everyone or im going to be at  home eating a pizza   please trust us   yeah   and you know   andand that is incredible  faith on my part but i know i  got to do it   randys replaced bob in a  final four situation because i  think randys willing to cast  his lot in with a good group of  people and hes found that  and he you know as long as he  keeps his end of the bargain  hes got a great run for this  game   she knows shes low man on  the totem pole  shes bound to  she may continue to dig her  grave all day long andand  yalls conclusion may shift   of course   as annoying as bob is i see  him as being as loyal and  trustworthy as the day is long   andand right now i cant  say the same thing about dan   i cant either   but im closer being able to  say it about susie than i am  about dan   dan is super vulnerable  tonight  and the only thing dan has going  for him right now is that he  should really cross his fingers  that susies going to blow up  and do some crazy stuff   i really like you and i  dont want you to go home  so im not writing your name  down and i just wanted you to  know that  youre just not on my list of   do you know whowho theyre  thinking about voting out   um i think that its going  to be dan   thats what your your guess  is its gonna be dan   i think so yeah  but we felt like we dont want  to take somebody thats gonna  flip  i feel really good about the  fact that you wouldnt   no i wouldnt as long as  you keep me in the loop  ii figured people were talking  and i figured eventually they  would come to me and tell me  where im at you know  cause i when i was gonna  okay im gonna be honest with  you  i was actually going to vote  you because   why   because i know that im a  hard worker  ii know that without having  fire and water and food how are  you going to perform physically  youre going to have to take  that time to do that work   mmhmm   so im just being totally up  front with you so and  thats the truth   okay so you need me to help  more   well yeah i need help from  everybody actually  so thats where im at  but ii appreciate that cause  now i know which way i can  swing   so this moron has decided  that shed like me to go  really  i hate her  i hate her hate her hate her  like i really want to stab her  in the face  and if you piss me off youve  pissed off my alliance   did i not say to you guys  shes nuts  i mean certifiable   but shes the worst kind of  nuts cause you dont see it  coming   she goes whichever way the  wind is blowing   um i mean i hate her  i want her gone yesterday   susies game is no game  and the problem with no game is  her vote can be bought  shes gone   tonight i dont want any  sort of curveball  i do not want to go home  tonight  i dont know what could be  cooking  i mean dan doesnt have the  idol does he   not that i know of   what if susie and dan get  together dan has the idol  and hes like lets both  vote corinne   then youre gone   lets just take her out  then she has to go   everybodys ass is on the  line  susie needs to go  shes annoying  i want her to go home and soon   so um heres the thing  my entire plan was wedged on the  fact that susie is easy she  trusts us and shes never  gonna win individual immunity  we can get rid of her when we  want  i didnt realize she wasi locoi  ien la cabezai  like i had no idea that that  was what i was dealing with   i am devastated right now   well im completely  frustrated because i feel like  we got some issues that we had  no idea existed   what do you think is the  safer bet  cause im really a little  concerned   were at the point where  i think either decision has  incredible risks associated  with it   right   thank god we have a  twoperson advantage at this  point  but dan could have the  immunity idol  but i really doubt it so  if he actually does have the  immunity idol we should vote  out susie   yeah   just in case theres an idol   yeah  were worried that dan has the  immunity idol because he spent  a couple days on exile island  but we also think that dan may  need to go  so unfortunately its not who  is the best asset  its who is the least risky  which stinks because you know  we still dont know who were  gonna be better off with   probst marcus is the game  at a point where youre now  looking out for yourself versus  keeping our tribe strong   i think were basing our  decision on what were  expecting to come in the next  few days  weve got to surround ourselves  with the most powerful crowd of  people because thats the only  way were going to survive an  onslaught from the rest of the  fang tribe   probst susie looking at  this tribe you got to be a  little concerned yourself  is it fair to say that youre  the weakest person on this  tribe in challenges   ii dont think i am  i think theres certain skills  that i may be a little bit  weaker at but   probst whos weaker than  you on this tribe   um i think strengthwise  upper strength i think im  stronger than corinne   probst corinne not buying  that at all   i dont want to insult her  i think that she is very  skilled and i think that she  does have athletic talent you  know   probst she just insulted  you   well yes and thats why im  telling you that i dont agree  i think that i have a lot to  offer  i think i have upper body  strength  i think ive got a lot of  things but   and you probably do  i dont i mean im just im  trying to just kind of observe  and just kind of see where this  games taking me and   probst corinne have you  picked up on susies tendencies  to maybe sometimes let loose   yeah but ive operated  without a filter for so many  years that like i totally  respect when people come out of  their shell and just say  whatever it is that theyre  thinking  i mean i would encourage more  of that  maybe you should blow up once  in a while and then ill know  you better   probst randy where do you  sit on the be yourself versus  hold it in   im probably about eight on a  scale of ten and thats good  and bad   probst whats good about it   i dont have to pretend  and uh you know people pretty  much know where i stand most of  the time   probst whats bad about it   i dont have to pretend and  people know where i stand most  of the time  laughter   probst dan where do you fit  in on that   um i tend to be a  worrywart and so it has  inhibited me from being  completely comfortable and  completely myself  but my result in the game will  fare much better if i can shake  it off and just relax   probst charlie how big a  factor is trust becoming   days in for this group of  seven   its huge because we intend  to go into a merge as a  powerful group together  and if someone splinters our  numbers will dwindle before the  fang numbers dwindle  so my vote is based on who i can  trust going into a merge most   probst corinne is it  possible that tonights vote  could be a mistake   damn yeah  i dont know if were making  the right decision or if i  personally am making the right  decision  i hope that i am   probst all right lets get  to the vote  marcus thanks to a nice  performance today you have  individual immunity  it is yours unless you choose  to give it to somebody else   we won it for kota but im  going to hang on to this one   probst all right you cannot  vote for marcus  everybody else is fair game  it is time to vote  bob youre up   dan  sorry guy   susie you have a uh a  great heart and im going to  vote with what i think the rest  of the tribe is voting   this is about dan not you   probst ill go tally the  votes  if anybody has the hidden  immunity idol and you want to  play it now would be the time  to do so  okay once the votes are read  the decision is final  person voted out will be  asked to leave the tribal  council area immediately  ill read the votes  first vote susie  dan  dan  two votes dan one vote susie  susie  were tied two votes susie  two votes dan  dan  three votes dan two votes  susie  susie  were tied three votes susie  three votes dan  one vote left  eighth person voted out of  isurvivor gaboni  dan  need to bring me your torch  dan the tribe has spoken  its time for you to go   thanks jeff   probst well despite being  very successful

know how we told you that your white blood cell are confused and theyre attacking your own body this should help uh calm them down im sorry it just the last few hour have just been so scary and no one seems to know whats causing this well hlh is an aggressive syndrome but it caused by an underlying condition that most people dont even know they have so the real question is whats underneath this how do we find out i get to know a much about you a i possibly can have you had covid that can be a trigger sometimes mm no not that i know of and where do you live what do you do for work um my son and i live in queen but we came from ukraine last year you got out after the russian bombed a school in our village i took dimi and we fled mustve been horrible we hid in farm stable stowed away in train car but we made it out we left our home behind and i vowed to give my son a better life here but a new country no family it been lonely and now this illness it mm whats wrong um what are you doing well im very sorry but i think i made a mistake this is not gonna help you hey brucellosis brucellosis thats yulia salenkos underlying condition howd you land there because when she fled the war in ukraine with her son they were hiding out in farm and stable it it livestock thats gotta be how she got it so in order to treat her hlh we have to completely rid her body of all trace of brucellosis yeah i already started her on a massive regimen of antibiotic all right so if she fled ukraine when the war began thats a year ago i mean the bacteria would have spread to every part of her body yeah thats untreated endocarditis i didnt say it wa gonna be easy max floyd if we dont at least try then she will have come all this way just to die here and her son is gonna be orphaned in a foreign country i hear you i do but what youre talking about this procedure it will literally take dozen of highly trained surgeon and specialist to pull it off by my count it gonna take you know damn well that money wa for courtneys brace and if my garage go under then what your garage is struggling because you ran it into the damn ground you know im doing whats best for this family no youre doing whats best for horace like always you never respect me im the man of this house then act like one floyd what did you do baby i put it back together for you clamp scalpel forceps popcorn on a stick okay now ready to implant porcine aortic valve dr wilder uh there nowhere else that i can stand well can you just a little no i have to be right beside dr gaffen and i need to be able to see ben we got no wiggle room over here floyd try over there oh god oh we just lost the bypass machine our patient just died but hey this is why we rehearse right max were packed in here so tight that if i just breathe im gonna knock something over i know we can rework the plan we can do some of the surgery individually instead of simultaneously anything thats gonna give u more space to work in here but it gonna add time that we cant afford i can help how i can replace the aortic valve while her heart still beating then we can get rid of this bypass machine so it doesnt take up so much space will that save time yes while her heart still beating have you ever done that before no okay you better start practicing all right what do you think stripe outrageous pattern which one neither what no tie huh what about a bolo albert wore a turquoise one on our first date and i found it quite fetching oh yes albert the new beau when do i get to meet the lucky fella huh what do you think dinner saturday night uh okay good we can chat about his affinity for southwestern apparel what are you doing oh im uh im ignoring him yeah i can see that mmhmm but why well because with selective mutism you do not pursue you create a path and let them come to you i have set the table so to speak now all he ha to do is come and feast he doesnt appear to be hungry not even a little bit mm hey hey lu mermaid

bit thats just me like thats how i am with group yeah yeah you know i like to be part of the group i would say that dan is socially inept in a lot of way i dont know if he a former fatty or why he wasnt liked a a child but deep down inside he a little kid thats seeking approval it different than fang where i alienated myself because i didnt like those people with you guy it completely opposite

theyre not all screwing me around probst come on in guy well now bring in sugar returning from exile island probst all right you guy ready to get to today immunity challenge yeah probst first thing first dan i will take it back thank you good news and bad news about today challenge bad news is both tribe are going to tribal council tonight both tribe are gonna vote somebody out the good news each of you will have an equal shot at winning individual immunity it a log roll youre gonna match up against another tribe member it might be somebody from the other tribe it might be somebody from your own tribe your goal is to stay on the log longer than the other person first person to hit the water is out winner move on last person left standing win immunity and is safe at tonight tribal council i think i may have a target on my back so it very very important for me personally to go in there and win and not just win by a little win by a lot probst in addition there is a twist which will be revealed after the challenge is over another twist probst well draw number get our matchup well get started all right first matchup dan taking on ace all right here we go put a foot on the log three two one walk we are on first matchup good footwork dan is in the water ace move on to the next round next round charlie versus crystal this challenge is on charlie and crystal looking to move on crystal in the water first charlie moving on to the next round big matchup marcus versus matty good save by marcus mattys in the water marcus moving on to the next round randy taking on susie both from the kota tribe nice footwork ah susie in the water first randy moving on to the next round kenny versus sugar two fang member this dumb thing laugh i cant even move this probst can he fight to hang on no kenny in the water first sugar moving on last of the first round bob and corinne of course he did laughter probst who knew that would come in handy here we go bob versus corinne bob the former log roll winner three two one walk bob whistling sugar laughing corinne in the water first bob moving on all right semifinal round we have our matchup charlie taking on ace go come on charlie probst the winner move on to the final round ace staying alive charlies got him on the run great match ace on the run can he recover charlies in the water first ace moving on to the final very close now it is marcus taking on randy one of you will move on to the final round come on randy probst randy on the run randy in the water first marcus moving on to the final round all right next round sugar versus bob were on winner move on to the final round to join ace and marcus great match sugar not going anywhere bob slip trying to hang on bob is back up a great recovery sugar scream bob in the water first sugar moving on congratulation probst the log rolling champion hit the water first youll be ridiculed back home laughter for the final round all three of you will be on the log at the same time groaning take your spot for the final round ace we drew for spot you got the middle you guy put a foot on the log hold it steady you know i feel this win is enormous so it important that i win this challenge if i can pull it off ill be proud of myself if not ill probably shoot myself in the pinky toe probst the challenge is on three people on the log at once the last person on the log win immunity good footwork by all three sugar with a nice save another nice save by marcus sugar on the run another nice save everybody still alive sugar in the water first it ace and marcus fighting for immunity great battle ace in the water first marcus win individual immunity whoo probst congratulation applause marcus safe at tonight tribal council now to the twist this is yours to read read it out loud so everybody can hear it you will now assign immunity to one member of the other tribe im going to give this to sugar probst sugar come on over applause my hope is that sugar is smart enough to keep the immunity idol to herself and that might actually end up giving u one of our biggest surprise which would be losing a big power player from the fang tribe in ace matty or crystal probst sugar safe at tonight tribal council for fang marcus is safe for kota when i saw sugar with the immunity necklace around her neck im like damn this girl ha two idol she is now the most powerful person in this game who would you have picked from the other tribe to give immunity to i dont know you dont know maybe susie susie yeah yeah you think susies gonna be gone tonight i think thats irritating people oh matty and ace theyre thinking to get rid of crystal and it all depends on the pinup girl sugar so yeah i will lie in this game i will do everything in my power to get her to vote with me because my life and crystal life rest upon her so basically this is honest to god truth this is whats happening around camp im not lying to you matty go were voting out sugar next immunity challenge and then crystal like okay so then when crystal went away i looked at ace im like are we really voting out sugar and ace is like right now sugar is really good for nothing except for the hidden immunity idol they think youre like clueless youre like a dumb blonde or whatever okay and ace think he ha you wrapped around his finger okay i dont trust kenny he might have been lying to me but i have been trusting the biggest snake in the game so far and ive known that so i really dont know who to trust at any point in this game ace is like well i actually got the hidden immunity idol from her once i can probably do that and then we can blindside her and then ill have the hidden immunity idol and i wa like oh my freaking god this guy is a snake you and i will say were voting on crystal we blindside ace blindside ace today and we dont have to worry about the snake ever again never again i trust sugar and i trust that she will go along with the plan to vote out ace she may be the pinup girl but shes very smart kenny ha reassured me all is well i will truly believe sugar when she writes ace name down either shes going to write my name or shes going to write ace name why who going to do that theyd only have two vote mattys with you theyd have three vote no itd be kenny and crystal wouldnt it i gave it back to you last time ill give it back to you this time oh ace i gotta think about it okay thats fine you make me feel awful when ace asked me for the idol it made me think maybe kenny wa telling me the truth dont you think after ace definitely know how to finagle people much more than ive ever seen anybody do probably in my life but he definitely had my back ill bring the last of it and then thats it all right go for it crystal supposed to go next but plan could change ace could be turning on me now i have no idea oh god what am i gonna do with this thing probst sugar youve been out here day tell me about camp life whats going on um we are very low on rice crystal accidentally knocked some over and she didnt eat because she knocked it over probst kenny how much rice did you have before crystal knocked it over we had about seven day worth crystal ended up scooping some of the rice that she spilled outside back into the pot so probably had about five and a half day worth of rice probst so matty the rice is so valuable that if you spill even a little in the dirt you gotta pick it out grain by grain the rice is valuable it the most valuable thing we have we get about six to eight spoonful a day of rice probst wow and she spill the rice and nobody go god crystal what are you doing nobody no but your face said it all just simmer down your face said it all my face say it all nobody say a word to her because they knew it wa an accident exactly so just i didnt purposely go over to the rice box and just throw the rice down just let me get to my point can i get to my point get to your point and then ill talk so then we looked past it we moved past that issue probst ace make sense of that for me crystal made a mistake thats common the whole part of u feeling angry at her i thought wa a bit concocted in her own head now im delusional i can see it on your face ace okay dont look at me like that when matty turned around he wa like oh whatever then he made some look at you ace i didnt say anything to anybody i just sat down there picking up about grain of rice and then they started to eat oh crystal come on and eat no i spilled some of the rice so i will go without and thats what i did and thats why i did it nobody asked you to crystal it not like you saved me any anyways you still ate it i asked you three time yeah i mean if you cared enough you wouldve saved me some anyways probst sugar you have like the perfect seat in the midst of this great shakespearean drama i know probst your eye are like saucer this sound like such petty bull crap to me i mean i think that we can get past our issue better than this and this is why we havent been winning because people are holding these stupid petty thing against each other probst all right sugar you have individual immunity tonight you can assign that to somebody else or keep it for yourself keeping it probst sugar is safe tonight everybody else is fair game it is time to vote ace youre up youre one of the snake and i got to get rid of you go home crystal ive been waiting for this day for so long and i am so happy it here probst ill go tally the vote if anybody ha the hidden immunity idol and you want to play it now would be the time to do so okay once the vote are read the decision is final the person voted out will be asked to leave the tribal council area immediately ill read the vote first vote ace crystal one vote ace one vote crystal ace two vote ace one vote crystal were tied two vote crystal two vote ace one vote left seventh person voted out of isurvivor gaboni ace thats three you need to bring me your torch probst ace the tribe ha spoken good luck guy probst well based on the reaction from ace id say that wa a blindside day in fang is finally starting to play this game grab your torch head back to camp good night dont go away coming up next kota prepares for their own tribal council right now would be an optimal time to get me out probst while dan dig his own grave susie commits social suicide i wa actually going to vote you really i hate her i want her gone yesterday can i ask you a question what im not going tonight am i not that i know of given the fact that everyones voting for susie it ha to be susie cause we have no idea we could stay together a a tribe for another two round right now would be an optimal time to get me out a a strong player so this is a huge vote for me because im either going to come back here and trust everyone or im going to be at home eating a pizza please trust u yeah and you know andand that is incredible faith on my part but i know i got to do it randys replaced bob in a final four situation because i think randys willing to cast his lot in with a good group of people and he found that and he you know a long a he keep his end of the bargain he got a great run for this game she know shes low man on the totem pole shes bound to she may continue to dig her grave all day long andand yalls conclusion may shift of course a annoying a bob is i see him a being a loyal and trustworthy a the day is long andand right now i cant say the same thing about dan i cant either but im closer being able to say it about susie than i am about dan dan is super vulnerable tonight and the only thing dan ha going for him right now is that he should really cross his finger that susies going to blow up and do some crazy stuff i really like you and i dont want you to go home so im not writing your name down and i just wanted you to know that youre just not on my list of do you know whowho theyre thinking about voting out um i think that it going to be dan thats what your your guess is it gonna be dan i think so yeah but we felt like we dont want to take somebody thats gonna flip i feel really good about the fact that you wouldnt no i wouldnt a long a you keep me in the loop ii figured people were talking and i figured eventually they would come to me and tell me where im at you know cause i when i wa gonna okay im gonna be honest with you i wa actually going to vote you because why because i know that im a hard worker ii know that without having fire and water and food how are you going to perform physically youre going to have to take that time to do that work mmhmm so im just being totally up front with you so and thats the truth okay so you need me to help more well yeah i need help from everybody actually so thats where im at but ii appreciate that cause now i know which way i can swing so this moron ha decided that shed like me to go really i hate her i hate her hate her hate her like i really want to stab her in the face and if you piss me off youve pissed off my alliance did i not say to you guy shes nut i mean certifiable but shes the worst kind of nut cause you dont see it coming she go whichever way the wind is blowing um i mean i hate her i want her gone yesterday susies game is no game and the problem with no game is her vote can be bought shes gone tonight i dont want any sort of curveball i do not want to go home tonight i dont know what could be cooking i mean dan doesnt have the idol doe he not that i know of what if susie and dan get together dan ha the idol and he like let both vote corinne then youre gone let just take her out then she ha to go everybodys as is on the line susie need to go shes annoying i want her to go home and soon so um here the thing my entire plan wa wedged on the fact that susie is easy she trust u and shes never gonna win individual immunity we can get rid of her when we want i didnt realize she wasi locoi ien la cabezai like i had no idea that that wa what i wa dealing with i am devastated right now well im completely frustrated because i feel like we got some issue that we had no idea existed what do you think is the safer bet cause im really a little concerned were at the point where i think either decision ha incredible risk associated with it right thank god we have a twoperson advantage at this point but dan could have the immunity idol but i really doubt it so if he actually doe have the immunity idol we should vote out susie yeah just in case there an idol yeah were worried that dan ha the immunity idol because he spent a couple day on exile island but we also think that dan may need to go so unfortunately it not who is the best asset it who is the least risky which stink because you know we still dont know who were gonna be better off with probst marcus is the game at a point where youre now looking out for yourself versus keeping our tribe strong i think were basing our decision on what were expecting to come in the next few day weve got to surround ourselves with the most powerful crowd of people because thats the only way were going to survive an onslaught from the rest of the fang tribe probst susie looking at this tribe you got to be a little concerned yourself is it fair to say that youre the weakest person on this tribe in challenge ii dont think i am i think there certain skill that i may be a little bit weaker at but probst who weaker than you on this tribe um i think strengthwise upper strength i think im stronger than corinne probst corinne not buying that at all i dont want to insult her i think that she is very skilled and i think that she doe have athletic talent you know probst she just insulted you well yes and thats why im telling you that i dont agree i think that i have a lot to offer i think i have upper body strength i think ive got a lot of thing but and you probably do i dont i mean im just im trying to just kind of observe and just kind of see where this game taking me and probst corinne have you picked up on susies tendency to maybe sometimes let loose yeah but ive operated without a filter for so many year that like i totally respect when people come out of their shell and just say whatever it is that theyre thinking i mean i would encourage more of that maybe you should blow up once in a while and then ill know you better probst randy where do you sit on the be yourself versus hold it in im probably about eight on a scale of ten and thats good and bad probst whats good about it i dont have to pretend and uh you know people pretty much know where i stand most of the time probst whats bad about it i dont have to pretend and people know where i stand most of the time laughter probst dan where do you fit in on that um i tend to be a worrywart and so it ha inhibited me from being completely comfortable and completely myself but my result in the game will fare much better if i can shake it off and just relax probst charlie how big a factor is trust becoming day in for this group of seven it huge because we intend to go into a merge a a powerful group together and if someone splinter our number will dwindle before the fang number dwindle so my vote is based on who i can trust going into a merge most probst corinne is it possible that tonight vote could be a mistake damn yeah i dont know if were making the right decision or if i personally am making the right decision i hope that i am probst all right let get to the vote marcus thanks to a nice performance today you have individual immunity it is yours unless you choose to give it to somebody else we won it for kota but im going to hang on to this one probst all right you cannot vote for marcus everybody else is fair game it is time to vote bob youre up dan sorry guy susie you have a uh a great heart and im going to vote with what i think the rest of the tribe is voting this is about dan not you probst ill go tally the vote if anybody ha the hidden immunity idol and you want to play it now would be the time to do so okay once the vote are read the decision is final person voted out will be asked to leave the tribal council area immediately ill read the vote first vote susie dan dan two vote dan one vote susie susie were tied two vote susie two vote dan dan three vote dan two vote susie susie were tied three vote susie three vote dan one vote left eighth person voted out of isurvivor gaboni dan need to

the surveillance videoi  ihoping that it would shed lighti  on the identities of the perpetrators  i i  iwe could see that willard was doing cleanupi  iin the store and then had gone to the back of the storei  ito stock the coolersi  he was busy doing his job  i i  ishortly before midnight two males come ini  ilarger male and a smaller malei  iboth of em are dressed in darker clothesi  itheir faces are coveredi  iboth of em are carrying handgunsi  ithe larger male is an african american malei  the other one was hard to tell  not enough skin showing  ihe could have been a lightskin african americani  ihe could have been whitei  ithe two suspects separated in the storei  ithe accomplice was over behind a racki  they obviously did not see willard  when they first came in  they knew he was somewhere and they figured he would emerge  i i  iso the lighterskin male goes behind the counteri  ito the cash register and there was like a back officei  ihe looked like he was looking probably for the clerki  i i  the heavierset male stands in front of the counter  ii guess more like lookouti  inarrator police continue watchingi  ias the masked gunmen move through the storei  ibefore willard suddenly emergesi  willard seemed to be pretty calm  ithe heavyset male started demanding money from himi  iand telling him to put his hands on the counteri  so willard refuses to do what he says  i i  iand gets struck by the heavierset malei  ithe other male then comes from behind the counteri  ijumps over the counter and basically fallsi  iknocking over some thingsi  and then willard is able to get back to his feet  they are sort of incredulous as to his refusal  and thats when the shooter takes a look  out the front door  i i  and shoots willard in the head  ithe two immediately turned to the door and walked outi  they didnt run out they walked out  i i  iit was sort of an impulse reactioni  isort of like im gonna show youi  type thing is the impression i got from looking at the video  isomber musici  i i  iwillard was very brave to do what he didi  you dont know the mindset of the person holding the gun  itheyre desperatei  itheyre unpredictablei  iwillard was a true innocent victimi  he was minding his own business  he had a job  he was trying to contribute to society  he didnt deserve to have this happen to him  i i  inarrator while rewatching willards final momentsi  imetz catches a glimpse of something of interesti  ithrough the store windowi  ishortly after they leavei  iyou can see an older model pickup ridei  through the front parking lot right past the front door  we thought that might not be coincidence  idramatic musici  i i  inarrator when reviewing surveillance footagei  iof willard grandstaffs murderi  iinvestigators spot a truck leaving the scenei  icould this vehicle be the key to identifying the killersi  i i  iit was believed it could be the suspect vehiclei  because of the short time between it circling through  and the two suspects entering the store  so in the absence of other information  we had to believe that that truck was in play  i i  its almost too good to be true  that its a coincidence that they just happened  to ride through at that point  inarrator as detectives collect informationi  ion the pickup truck they notice something intriguingi  iat the beginning of the encounteri  ii am rita shuler retired special agenti  iwith the south carolina law enforcement divisioni  another very important thing that the investigators saw  was when the slender guy jumped over the counter  ihe jumped and his palm touched the counteri  i i  ithey figured oh we may be able to dust the counteri  iand get a palm printi  that we could possibly lead back to him  iand we processed the counter area very deliberatelyi  in hopes that would produce a latent print or dna  that would help solve this case  i i  inarrator while awaiting results from forensicsi  isomething about this crime isnt sitting righti  iwith investigator metzi  the one thing that got me was just the callousness  of the way he was shot was totally uncalled for  there was no reason behind this  iafter they shoot willard they leave the storei  they dont get any money  they didnt gain anything out of what they did  it was just senseless  inarrator the closerange nature of the shootingi  ileads metz to reconsider an earlier theoryi  ifrom the crime scenei  iwhen youre looking at a case like thisi  you have to look at if there was anybody  that had some type of beef or argument with willard  i i  an individual may come in and try to steal a pack of beer  ibut to go take that next step and to murder the clerki  iis unusuali  i i  inarrator investigators question willards coworkersi  iand find out a surprising piece of informationi  iwhen we looked at possible suspectsi  iwe learned from managementi  that willard had thwarted a previous attempt  to steal money out of the register  register dings  in this particular instance he was successful  in defending the store at that point in time  iwe found that video and we worked on thati  ito see if maybe that individual came backi  iand wanted to retaliatei  inarrator investigators compare the featuresi  iof willards assailants to the footagei  iof the prior robbery attempti  iwe take a close look at him look at his heighti  ihis weight but his physical characteristics didnt matchi  i i  inarrator despite the dead endi  iinvestigators believe that the close encounteri  iprovides insight into willards mindseti  ithe night he was murderedi  it told us a lot about willard as a person  ihe was proud of his jobi  it may have given him confidence to stand up  against these other two guys  ihe was not afraidi  we gotta believe that maybe he was bolstered some  by his previous efforts to defend the store  i i  isoft musici  inarrator four days after the murderi  ion october ndi  iwillard grandstaff is laid to resti  ii was a pallbearer at his funerali  ii walked up to his bodyi  iand im screaming no stop dont do thisi  wake up lets go home  and i sat down and finally got myself together  and his mom said robert you need to let him go  hes at rest now  the good lord wanted him for something besides here  isoft musici  iwe would play pretend gamesi  i remember one time he got me a ring pop  and it was the magic ring  ii was like a princess and he was the knighti  iit was cutei  he was the brother i didnt have but always wanted  and i didnt have him for long enough  i i  idramatic musici  inarrator in the weeks after the murderi  ithe case is at a standstilli  iwe just were basically stymiedi  iin the early part of this investigationi  when you have a case like this where youre basically  your investigation has  really turned cold kind of quickly  iyoure just desperately looking for similar crimesi  itrends involving maybe a weapon of the same caliberi  ithings of that naturei  iunfortunately we have a loti  iof convenience store robberiesi  anybody that we learn about thats committing  you know violent armed robberies and shooting people  iwould have been subjects of interesti  iin this investigationi  we had to look at everything  inarrator investigators then get a calli  iwith a promising tipi  ianother agency gave us a lead on some peoplei  that were committing some other burglaries  in the area at the time  ishamik and princetoni  ithe half brothers were on the radar becausei  they had been in the south during that time period  inarrator investigators reach out to all police agenciesi  iin the area gathering as much informationi  iabout their new leadi  ithey definitely had violent thingsi  in their criminal histories  itheyre buying and selling gunsi  iand they could have possibly been in the areai  theyre two people who were gonna have to look at  idramatic musici  i i  inarrator while investigatorsi  iin the willard grandstaff murderi  iwait for detailed reports on their new suspectsi  ithey reexamine forensic evidencei  icollected at the scene to see if there is a linki  ithe forensic unit is pretty much looking for everythingi  and of course the main things is fingerprints  i i  iwell when you examine the surveillance videoi  iobviously youre interested in surfacesi  ithat may have been touchedi  dna is so sophisticated now  that skin cell tissue can leave  what we call touch dna  but its very hard when its a public store like this  ieverybody that comes in there could touch that counteri  i i  you basically get a mixture of dna  thats unidentifiable exclusively to one person  and its virtually impossible to isolate it  iim john meadorsi  iand i was in charge of the prosecutioni  iin the murder of willard grandstaffi  unfortunately there werent forensics  there wasnt dna  i i  ithere werent fingerprintsi  there may have been one partial palm print  but was not something that law enforcement could use  i i  inarrator with no viable forensic evidencei  idetectives reach back out to the agencyi  ithat provided the tipi  i i  iat that point wed deal with investigatorsi  iwe would have them take full body picturesi  ishowing tattoos or anythingi  and then start doing a comparison there  to see if things match up  inarrator investigators search for the suspectsi  itakes a turn when they receive a new updatei  iwe find out that the same time as willard was killedi  ithe half brothers were incarcerated in another statei  i i  iboth of them were caught up north somewherei  at that point they were eliminated  because we knew they were committing crimes  at other places at the time that this murder occurred  i i  ithe trail became cold and we were desperate for a leadi  we were at a dead end  i i  inarrator months after willards murderi  ithe investigation is at a standstilli  iand his family is still on edgei  iafter will was murderedi  i know that my parents made extra sure  to lock the doors and like double check  before they ever went to go do anything  ii think they were worriedi  imy mom worked at the storei  ii wanted my mom to come homei  ii didnt want her to get hurti  ii worried a lot that someone else was gonna diei  i try not to think about that store ever  i i  inarrator with little else to go oni  iinvestigators make a bold movei  the sheriffs department decides to air this footage  on the news the local news channels in columbia  in hopes that someone may identify the suspects  or even identify this truck  i i  iwhen you release surveillance videoi  ior you make an appeal to the publici  youll take information from whatever source it comes  inarrator but not everyone is excited about the releasei  iof the surveillance videoi  ii remember they brought the video overi  but they wouldnt let me watch it because i was a child  so to this day ive still never seen the video  isoft musici  when they showed the story on the news  ii started screamingi  ii had to literally get up and walk awayi  ifrom the televisioni  ii started crying missing himi  i wish he was still here  idramatic musici  i i  days became weeks weeks became months  iduring that time law enforcement was working on iti  they were getting leads they were running down leads  ithey were still showing the video periodicallyi  ikeeping it out in the publici  but in cases like this where you dont have a witness  iwhat usually happens is that somebody out therei  the culprits are either gonna talk and mess up  or somebody gets in trouble and wants a deal to help  inarrator in march  their luck begins to changei  one of our narcotics agents made an arrest  of an individual named chris ellis  iwho had several priors involving narcotics violationsi  iand this is gonna be onei  ithat could create some serious problems for himi  ibased on his prior convictionsi  ithis individual reached out to the narcotics agenti  iwho was involved in his casei  indicated to him he had significant knowledge  about this murder  that was passed on to my lead detective  and myself  inarrator investigators agree to sit down with ellisi  iwho is currently incarcerated at the county jaili  ithey begin by asking about his whereaboutsi  iaround the time of the murderi  ichris ellis tells us that hes at home the next morningi  iand that the shooter comes back to the housei  and gives him the gun  and asks him to get rid of the gun for him  iand describes to him what had gone oni  iwhich matched up with what had gone oni  iat the kangaroo with willardi  ihe had specific details about the actual crime itselfi  he knew the actual caliber of the weapon involved  which is very significant  inarrator theres one way to find outi  iif chris ellis is telling the truthi  after chris initial statement  we polygraphed chris  ia cold case may go back on the shelfi  ibut theres always a possibilityi  of pulling it back off when something new comes in  i i  iin this particular case chris was that one tipi  that possibly changes everything  idramatic musici  i i  inarrator investigators in the willard grandstaff murder casei  iare trying to determine if a prison informanti  inamed chris ellis is lyingi  its very commonplace for individuals  who are incarcerated to try to gain some advantage  by helping solve crime  i i  ibut chris ellis failed the polygraphi  i i  iand what he was lying to us about wasi  who was the heavierset accomplice  i i  iwell after he failed the polygraphi  he came clean about the involvement  of his cousin lamont ellis  inarrator according to chris his cousin was the accomplicei  ito the shooteri  ichris ellis did not want to implicate his cousini  ilamont ellisi  ithat was the most significant mistruthi  ithat he had initiallyi  but once we got through that  we were able to verify what he was telling us  i i  what helped make him credible in my mind  was that he was telling on a family member  which is not easy to do  i i  inarrator investigators push for the identityi  iof the killeri  jaime marrero is who chris ellis identified  as the shooter  i i  iwhen we started checking in jaime marreroi  iwe realized he had a violent historyi  i i  ihe had been involved in another shootingi  a homicide several years back where he was actually shot  i i  things were falling into place  like none of the other leads had  inarrator investigators comparei  ijaime marrero and lamont ellis to the masked gunmeni  iin the surveillance videoi  the video was able to show their body height structure  iand type and it did matchi  iit was a key piece of evidence without questioni  ijaime matches up to the smaller guyi  and lamont definitely matches up with the larger male  i i  the two individuals match the physical description  of the two suspects to a t  i i  inarrator investigators ask ellisi  iabout the pickup truck seen in the videoi  iwe find out from chrisi  that the truck had nothing to do with the case  iwe never were able to identify who was in the trucki  but they were in one of their relatives car  and had been driving it that night  inarrator now to build a case against marrero and ellisi  iinvestigators zero in on a piece of potential evidencei  i i  according to chris ellis  jaime marrero came to his house  asked him to get rid of the gun  i i  ichris told me that he had thrown the gun in a pondi  in the lower part of the county in a rural area  he had some connection to that pond  because of a relative living close by  ii went to the pond with law enforcementi  iand richland county diversi  i learned ponds are some of the toughest things  to dive for cause you cant see  i i  we searched that pond for days  ibut were not able to recover iti  inarrator desperate for more evidencei  iinvestigators attempt to leverage their best asseti  iwhen you have a crime like thisi  with a lack of forensic evidence or ballistics  and youve got somebody thats giving you a tip  that is acquainted with the suspects  a pretext phone call is an investigative technique  that is often used  iits a call that we recordi  iand we attempt to get either a confession over the phonei  ior acknowledgement of the crimei  iwe set up a patch call where chris called jaime marreroi  to see if jaimes gonna say anything incriminating  cristopher was able to get jaime on the phone  and jaime basically said why are you doing this  iwhy are you talking to me about this on the telephonei  if you called me and asked me about a homicide  and was implicating me in saying that  tell me about what happened  id be telling you i dont know i wasnt there  and thats not what jaime was saying  which in our view was basically an acknowledgement  iwhich was very significanti  ithe content of the conversationi  corroborated chris information immediately  and that was significant to chris credibility  i i  inarrator then the attention shifts to a different memberi  iof the ellis familyi  ichris girlfriend at the timei  was cooperative in the investigation  and she had some degree of influence on lamont  i i  iof course lamont finds out from the othersi  ithat hes being given upi  icommunication is made with lamonti  who then calls into the sheriffs department  iand offers to come into the sheriffs departmenti  inarrator lamont ellis sits down with investigatorsi  ito share insight into exactly how and why willard diedi  that night they had gone out to a pool hall  that was right behind the kangaroo  iwhen they left there jaime was talkingi  iabout doing the robberyi  inarrator but according to lamonti  iwhen willard resistedi  imarrero lost his cooli  i i  lamont was pretty much upset that jaime had shot the guy  said that was not necessary  iafter we got lamont ellis statementi  iand he fully corroborated christophers tipi  that was enough for us to secure arrest warrants  for jaime marrero  i i  inarrator willards family is pleasedi  iwith investigators progressi  ibut they find some of the case details shockingi  ithe accomplice that was arrested lamonti  my mom knew his mom and had kind of seen him grow up  so everyone was kind of surprised to hear  that lamont was involved  inarrator in a strange coincidencei  irobert cribb believes the events of august thi  iwere not willard and lamonts first encounteri  ilamont was in wills classi  ihe pushed will outsidei  and i said no lamont you need to stop  and leave him alone  isomber musici  iwhen they told me they had caught the killersi  ii felt relievedi  i felt will got the peace he deserved  i i  inarrator lamont ellis is charged with assaulti  iand robberyi  ijaime marrero is charged with the murderi  iof willard grandstaffi  idramatic musici  ihis trial is set for september i  i i  this was a murder this was a coldblooded murder  and he needed to be convicted of that  idramatic musici  i i  inarrator on september nd i  ithe trial for the murder of willard grandstaff beginsi  i i  ibut theres a problemi  i been doing this a long time  and i love what i do  i love doing this job  ibut this case was not an easy casei  ithere just was not any evidencei  no forensics no dna  it was a tough case for law enforcement to crack  no question about it  i i  inarrator without something directly linking himi  ito the murderi  iprosecutors fear marrero will walki  we dont stop the investigations  when the arrest takes place  we obviously wanted to build as strong a case as possible  ione of the other significant parts of the investigationi  ipostarrests were some jailhouse phone callsi  ione of those calls mr jaime marrero was talkingi  to his girlfriend and as a result of that  law enforcement went and talked to her  i i  she said that he had confessed to her  law enforcement obviously was excited at that news  inarrator just days into the triali  ithe prosecutions new star witness takes the standi  iyou know some folks are just crediblei  ithey just reek with credibilityi  and her testimony was powerful  and i can visually remember looking at marrero  and he was actually slipping down in his seat  as she was testifying  and he felt it and i know the jury felt it  it was just strong credible evidence  im so glad she came forward  it was a good circumstantial evidence case  with her testimony it really took it up a notch too  i i  iafter her testimonyi  ijaimes lawyer asked the judge for a breaki  ijaime wanted to speak to family membersi  but after a period of time  ihe made what appeared to be a very emotional decisioni  to plead guilty to murder and attempted armed robbery  inarrator lamont ellis is sentenced to five yearsi  ifor conspiracy and ten years for assaulti  ijaime marrero is sentenced to  years in prisoni  ifor the murder of willard grandstaffi  isoft musici  a plea to murder is a little bit unusual  because murder carries a minimum of   in south carolina to life  its what we call pine box life  so securing a murder conviction  a nonparolable offense  and then getting  years we felt pretty good about that  ithat video itll always be with youi  iyou can never forget iti  i actually ride by the kangaroo every day  going to my job and look over there  and think about this case every day  i i  inarrator willards family remember the young mani  iwho in his final moments gave his lifei  ito protect the place that he lovedi  i i  i i  istill to this day gets to mei  i i  iknowing that i miss him every dayi  iand wish he was still here to talk to mei  ii walk up to his grave and ill sayi  hey will i miss you  i wish you were still here so we could go hang out somewhere  go get something to eat somewhere or something  and i can literally feel like hes putting his arm  around me telling me hey buddy how are you  im right here with you  iand then within two seconds its gonei  i guess his way of telling me hey im here  im glad to see you  im doing okay  and ill believe that till my dying day  i i  if i could do anything id want to give him a hug  i miss his hugs i still remember his hugs  he gave bear hugs and they were just the best hugs  ihes the person you would have wanted to be friends withi  i i  i like how my aunt put it on his headstone  he was a gentle soul  thats what he was big friendly giant  i i \",\n          \"script info title default file scripttype v wrapstyle  playresx  playresy  scaledborderandshadow yes audio file video file video aspect ratio  video zoom

clue buriedi iin willard final momentsi the accomplice wa laying in wait ithey knew he wa somewherei inarrator an inside tip suggests a surprising motivei to go take that next step into murder is

ito the call from the kangaroo expressi iim j stan smithi ideputy chief of the richland county sheriff departmenti icriminal investigative divisioni ithe individual were obviously in a state of shocki what they had seen when theyd arrived at the store but they immediately called iand we had em summoned to the scenei ito look for sign of lifei i i ibut the individual had passed awayi crime scene investigator became involved at that point ithe sergeant on duty briefed myselfi and spoke to the two people who had reported it iafter that we began the investigationi i i so when we go inside we see the clerk on the floor in front of the counter and blood around his head iand what appeared to be a gunshot wound to his headi i i a wound like that look like it pretty closeup iyou know were talking pointblanki ithere could be a lot of explanation for thati imaybe somebody wa mad at himi did somebody have a big beef with him or hatred for him i i ithe victim had identification on himi iand we were able to make contact with the managementi iof the store relatively quicklyi so we confirmed his identity through management i i iwe were able to identifyi that the clerk wa willard grandstaff i i iwillards uncle wa manager at the storei and he assisted u while we were there iits never good to have a personi iyoung a willard diei iits never easy on a familyi when something like this happens i i isomber musici i i ii went into a severe deep depressioni i didnt want to do anything and all i wanted to do wa be with him ii wa six when will diedi ihe wa my absolute best friendi i dont know if i truly had a concept of death at that time but i knew he wasnt coming home i i inarrator to piece together what happened to willardi iinvestigators and crime scene techniciansi iprocess the scenei isome of the display rack in front of the counteri ihad been knocked overi appeared to have been some type of struggle ithe crime scene unit informed usi ithat they had found a caliber shell casingi ithe shell casing thats very significanti iin any investigation cause first of alli iit tell you what gun youre looking fori and then ultimately if you recovered a weapon you could match it ballistically to the shell casing inarrator after bagging the casingi iinvestigators spot something in the storeroomi i i iits very rare to get surveillance footagei iof an actual murderi a convenience store would be a good opportunity where you do have surveillance video to show theft iand thing of that naturei i i iin this particular instance it wa videoedi iand so the effort were made to collecti iand secure the surveillance videoi ihoping that it would shed lighti on the identity of the perpetrator i i iwe could see that willard wa doing cleanupi iin the store and then had gone to the back of the storei ito stock the coolersi he wa busy doing his job i i ishortly before midnight two male come ini ilarger male and a smaller malei iboth of em are dressed in darker clothesi itheir face are coveredi iboth of em are carrying handgunsi ithe larger male is an african american malei the other one wa hard to tell not enough skin showing ihe could have been a lightskin african americani ihe could have been whitei ithe two suspect separated in the storei ithe accomplice wa over behind a racki they obviously did not see willard when they first came in they knew he wa somewhere and they figured he would emerge i i iso the lighterskin male go behind the counteri ito the cash register and there wa like a back officei ihe looked like he wa looking probably for the clerki i i the heavierset male stand in front of the counter ii guess more like lookouti inarrator police continue watchingi ia the masked gunman move through the storei ibefore willard suddenly emergesi willard seemed to be pretty calm ithe heavyset male started demanding money from himi iand telling him to put his hand on the counteri so willard refuse to do what he say i i iand get struck by the heavierset malei ithe other male then come from behind the counteri ijumps over the counter and basically fallsi iknocking over some thingsi and then willard is able to get back to his foot they are sort of incredulous a to his refusal and thats when the shooter take a look out the front door i i and shoot willard in the head ithe two immediately turned to the door and walked outi they didnt run out they walked out i i iit wa sort of an impulse reactioni isort of like im gonna show youi type thing is the impression i got from looking at the video isomber musici i i iwillard wa very brave to do what he didi you dont know the mindset of the person holding the gun itheyre desperatei itheyre unpredictablei iwillard wa a true innocent victimi he wa minding his own business he had a job he wa trying to contribute to society he didnt deserve to have this happen to him i i inarrator while rewatching willard final momentsi imetz catch a glimpse of something of interesti ithrough the store windowi ishortly after they leavei iyou can see an older model pickup ridei through the front parking lot right past the front door we thought that might not be coincidence idramatic musici i i inarrator when reviewing surveillance footagei iof willard grandstaffs murderi iinvestigators spot a truck leaving the scenei icould this vehicle be the key to identifying the killersi i i iit wa believed it could be the suspect vehiclei because of the short time between it circling through and the two suspect entering the store so in the absence of other information we had to believe that that truck wa in play i i it almost too good to be true that it a coincidence that they just happened to ride through at that point inarrator a detective collect informationi ion the pickup truck they notice something intriguingi iat the beginning of the encounteri ii am rita shuler retired special agenti iwith the south carolina law enforcement divisioni another very important thing that the investigator saw wa when the slender guy jumped over the counter ihe jumped and his palm touched the counteri i i ithey figured oh we may be able to dust the counteri iand get a palm printi that we could possibly lead back to him iand we processed the counter area very deliberatelyi in hope that would produce a latent print or dna that would help solve this case i i inarrator while awaiting result from forensicsi isomething about this crime isnt sitting righti iwith investigator metzi the one thing that got me wa just the callousness of the way he wa shot wa totally uncalled for there wa no reason behind this iafter they shoot willard they leave the storei they dont get any money they didnt gain anything out of what they did it wa just senseless inarrator the closerange nature of the shootingi ileads metz to reconsider an earlier theoryi ifrom the crime scenei iwhen youre looking at a case like thisi you have to look at if there wa anybody that had some type of beef or argument with willard i i an individual may come in and try to steal a pack of beer ibut to go take that next step and to murder the clerki ii unusuali i i inarrator investigator question willard coworkersi iand find out a surprising piece of informationi iwhen we looked at possible suspectsi iwe learned from managementi that willard had thwarted a previous attempt to steal money out of the register register ding in this particular instance he wa successful in defending the store at that point in time iwe found that video and we worked on thati ito see if maybe that individual came backi iand wanted to retaliatei inarrator investigator compare the featuresi iof willard assailant to the footagei iof the prior robbery attempti iwe take a close look at him look at his heighti ihis weight but his physical characteristic didnt matchi i i inarrator despite the dead endi iinvestigators believe that the close encounteri iprovides insight into willard mindseti ithe night he wa murderedi it told u a lot about willard a a person ihe wa proud of his jobi it may have given him confidence to stand up against these other two guy ihe wa not afraidi we gotta believe that maybe he wa bolstered some by his previous effort to defend the store i i isoft musici inarrator four day after the murderi ion october ndi iwillard grandstaff is laid to resti ii wa a pallbearer at his funerali ii walked up to his bodyi iand im screaming no stop dont do thisi wake up let go home and i sat down and finally got myself together and his mom said robert you need to let him go he at rest now the good lord wanted him for something besides here isoft musici iwe would play pretend gamesi i remember one time he got me a ring pop and it wa the magic ring ii wa like a princess and he wa the knighti iit wa cutei he wa the brother i didnt have but always wanted and i didnt have him for long enough i i idramatic musici inarrator in the week after the murderi ithe case is at a standstilli iwe just were basically stymiedi iin the early part of this investigationi when you have a case like this where youre basically your investigation ha really turned cold kind of quickly iyoure just desperately looking for similar crimesi itrends involving maybe a weapon of the same caliberi ithings of that naturei iunfortunately we have a loti iof convenience store robberiesi anybody that we learn about thats committing you know violent armed robbery and shooting people iwould have been subject of interesti iin this investigationi we had to look at everything inarrator investigator then get a callus iwith a promising tipi ianother agency gave u a lead on some peoplei that were committing some other burglary in the area at the time ishamik and princetoni ithe half brother were on the radar becausei they had been in the south during that time period inarrator investigator reach out to all police agenciesi iin the area gathering a much informationi iabout their new leadi ithey definitely had violent thingsi in their criminal history itheyre buying and selling gunsi iand they could have possibly been in the areai theyre two people who were gonna have to look at idramatic musici i i inarrator while investigatorsi iin the willard grandstaff murderi iwait for detailed report on their new suspectsi ithey reexamine forensic evidencei icollected at the scene to see if there is a linki ithe forensic unit is pretty much looking for everythingi and of course the main thing is fingerprint i i iwell when you examine the surveillance videoi iobviously youre interested in surfacesi ithat may have been touchedi dna is so sophisticated now that skin cell tissue can leave what we call touch dna but it very hard when it a public store like this ieverybody that come in there could touch that counteri i i you basically get a mixture of dna thats unidentifiable exclusively to one person and it virtually impossible to isolate it iim john meadorsi iand i wa in charge of the prosecutioni iin the murder of willard grandstaffi unfortunately there werent forensics there wasnt dna i i ithere werent fingerprintsi there may have been one partial palm print but wa not something that law enforcement could use i i inarrator with no viable forensic evidencei idetectives reach back out to the agencyi ithat provided the tipi i i iat that point wed deal with investigatorsi iwe would have them take full body picturesi ishowing tattoo or anythingi and then start doing a comparison there to see if thing match up inarrator investigator search for the suspectsi itakes a turn when they receive a new updatei iwe find out that the same time a willard wa killedi ithe half brother were incarcerated in another statei i i iboth of them were caught up north somewherei at that point they were eliminated because we knew they were committing crime at other place at the time that this murder occurred i i ithe trail became cold and we were desperate for a leadi we were at a dead end i i inarrator month after willard murderi ithe investigation is at a standstilli iand his family is still on edgei iafter will wa murderedi i know that my parent made extra sure to lock the door and like double check before they ever went to go do anything ii think they were worriedi imy mom worked at the storei ii wanted my mom to come homei ii didnt want her to get hurti ii worried a lot that someone else wa gonna diei i try not to think about that store ever i i inarrator with little else to go oni iinvestigators make a bold movei the sheriff department decides to air this footage on the news the local news channel in columbia in hope that someone may identify the suspect or even identify this truck i i iwhen you release surveillance videoi ior you make an appeal to the publici youll take information from whatever source it come inarrator but not everyone is excited about the releasei iof the surveillance videoi ii remember they brought the video overi but they wouldnt let me watch it because i wa a child so to this day ive still never seen the video isoft musici when they showed the story on the news ii started screamingi ii had to literally get up and walk awayi ifrom the televisioni ii started cry missing himi i wish he wa still here idramatic musici i i day became week week became month iduring that time law enforcement wa working on iti they were getting lead they were running down lead ithey were still showing the video periodicallyi ikeeping it out in the publici but in case like this where you dont have a witness iwhat usually happens is that somebody out therei the culprit are either gonna talk and mess up or somebody get in trouble and want a deal to help inarrator in march their luck begin to changei one of our narcotic agent made an arrest of an individual named chris elli iwho had several prior involving narcotic violationsi iand this is gonna be onei ithat could create some serious problem for himi ibased on his prior convictionsi ithis individual reached out to the narcotic agenti iwho wa involved in his casei indicated to him he had significant knowledge about this murder that wa passed on to my lead detective and myself inarrator investigator agree to sit down with ellisi iwho is currently incarcerated at the county jaili ithey begin by asking about his whereaboutsi iaround the time of the murderi ichris elli tell u that he at home the next morningi iand that the shooter come back to the housei and give him the gun and asks him to get rid of the gun for him iand describes to him what had gone oni iwhich matched up with what had gone oni iat the kangaroo with willardi ihe had specific detail about the actual crime itselfi he knew the actual caliber of the weapon involved which is very significant inarrator there one way to find outi iif chris elli is telling the truthi after chris initial statement we polygraphed chris ia cold case may go back on the shelfi ibut there always a possibilityi of pulling it back off when something new come in i i iin this particular case chris wa that one tipi that possibly change everything idramatic musici i i inarrator investigator in the willard grandstaff murder casei iare trying to determine if a prison informanti inamed chris elli is lyingi it very commonplace for individual who are incarcerated to try to gain some advantage by helping solve crime i i ibut chris elli failed the polygraphi i i iand what he wa lying to u about wasi who wa the heavierset accomplice i i iwell after he failed the polygraphi he came clean about the involvement of his cousin lamont elli inarrator according to chris his cousin wa the accomplicei ito the shooteri ichris elli did not want to implicate his cousini ilamont ellisi ithat wa the most significant mistruthi ithat he had initiallyi but once we got through that we were able to verify what he wa telling u i i what helped make him credible in my mind wa that he wa telling on a family member which is not easy to do i i inarrator investigator push for the identityi iof the killeri jaime marrero is who chris elli identified a the shooter i i iwhen we started checking in jaime marreroi iwe realized he had a violent historyi i i ihe had been involved in another shootingi a homicide several year back where he wa actually shot i i thing were falling into place like none of the other lead had inarrator investigator comparei ijaime marrero and lamont elli to the masked gunmeni iin the surveillance videoi the video wa able to show their body height structure iand type and it did matchi iit wa a key piece of evidence without questioni ijaime match up to the smaller guyi and lamont definitely match up with the larger male i i the two individual match the physical description of the two suspect to a t i i inarrator investigator ask ellisi iabout the pickup truck seen in the videoi iwe find out from chrisi that the truck had nothing to do with the case iwe never were able to identify who wa in the trucki but they were in one of their relative car and had been driving it that night inarrator now to build a case against marrero and ellisi iinvestigators zero in on a piece of potential evidencei i i according to chris elli jaime marrero came to his house asked him to get rid of the gun i i ichris told me that he had thrown the gun in a pondi in the lower part of the county in a rural area he had some connection to that pond because of a relative living close by ii went to the pond with law enforcementi iand richland county diversi i learned pond are some of the toughest thing to dive for cause you cant see i i we searched that pond for day ibut were not able to recover iti inarrator desperate for more evidencei iinvestigators attempt to leverage their best asseti iwhen you have a crime like thisi with a lack of forensic evidence or ballistics and youve got somebody thats giving you a tip that is acquainted with the suspect a pretext phone call is an investigative technique that is often used iits a call that we recordi iand we attempt to get either a confession over the phonei ior acknowledgement of the crimei iwe set up a patch call where chris called jaime marreroi to see if jaimes gonna say anything incriminating cristopher wa able to get jaime on the phone and jaime basically said why are you doing this iwhy are you talking to me about this on the telephonei if you called me and asked me about a homicide and wa implicating me in saying that tell me about what happened id be telling you i dont know i wasnt there and thats not what jaime wa saying which in our view wa basically an acknowledgement iwhich wa very significanti ithe content of the conversationi corroborated chris information immediately and that wa significant to chris credibility i i inarrator then the attention shift to a different memberi iof the elli familyi ichris girlfriend at the timei wa cooperative in the investigation and she had some degree of influence on lamont i i iof course lamont find out from the othersi ithat he being given upi icommunication is made with lamonti who then call into the sheriff department iand offer to come into the sheriff departmenti inarrator lamont elli sits down with investigatorsi ito share insight into exactly how and why willard diedi that night they had gone out to a pool hall that wa right behind the kangaroo iwhen they left there jaime wa talkingi iabout doing the robberyi inarrator but according to lamonti iwhen willard resistedi imarrero lost his cooli i i lamont wa pretty much upset that jaime had shot the guy said that wa not necessary iafter we got lamont elli statementi iand he fully corroborated christopher tipi that wa enough for u to secure arrest warrant for jaime marrero i i inarrator willard family is pleasedi iwith investigator progressi ibut they find some of the case detail shockingi ithe accomplice that wa arrested lamonti my mom knew his mom and had kind of seen him grow up so everyone wa kind of surprised to hear that lamont wa involved inarrator in a strange coincidencei irobert cribb belief the event of august thi iwere not willard and lamonts first encounteri ilamont wa in will classi ihe pushed will outsidei and i said no lamont you need to stop and leave him alone isomber musici iwhen they told me they had caught the killersi ii felt relievedi i felt will got the peace he deserved i i inarrator lamont elli is charged with assaulti iand robberyi ijaime marrero is charged with the murderi iof willard grandstaffi idramatic musici ihis trial is set for september i i i this wa a murder this wa a coldblooded murder and he needed to be convicted of that idramatic musici i i inarrator on september nd i ithe trial for the murder of willard grandstaff beginsi i i ibut there a problemi i been doing this a long time and i love what i do i love doing this job ibut this case wa not an easy casei ithere just wa not any evidencei no forensics no dna it wa a tough case for law enforcement to crack no question about it i i inarrator without something directly linking himi ito the murderi iprosecutors fear marrero will walki we dont stop the investigation when the arrest take place we obviously wanted to build a strong a case a possible ione of the other significant part of the investigationi ipostarrests were some jailhouse phone callsi ione of those call mr jaime marrero wa talkingi to his girlfriend and a a result of that law enforcement went and talked to her i i she said that he had confessed to her law enforcement obviously wa excited at that news inarrator just day into the triali ithe prosecution new star witness take the standi iyou know some folk are just crediblei ithey just reek with credibilityi and her testimony wa powerful and i can visually remember looking at marrero and he wa actually slipping down in his seat a she wa testifying and he felt it and i know the jury felt it it wa just strong credible evidence im so glad she came forward it wa a good circumstantial evidence case with her testimony it really took it up a notch too i i iafter her testimonyi ijaimes lawyer asked the judge for a breaki ijaime wanted to speak to family membersi but after a period of time ihe made what appeared to be a very emotional decisioni to plead guilty to murder and attempted armed robbery inarrator lamont elli is sentenced to five yearsi ifor conspiracy and ten year for assaulti ijaime marrero is sentenced to year in prisoni ifor the murder of willard grandstaffi isoft musici a plea to murder is a little bit unusual because murder carry a minimum of in south carolina to life it what we call pine box life so securing a murder conviction a nonparolable offense and then getting year we felt pretty good about that ithat video itll always be with youi iyou can never forget iti i actually ride by the kangaroo every day going to my job and look over there and think about this case every day i i inarrator willard family remember the young mani iwho in his final moment gave his lifei ito protect the place that he lovedi i i i i istill to this day get to mei i i iknowing that i miss him every dayi iand wish he wa still here to talk to mei ii walk up to his grave and ill sayi hey will i miss you i wish you were still here so we could go hang out somewhere go get something to eat somewhere or something and i can literally feel like he putting his arm around me telling me hey buddy how are you im right here with you iand then within two second it gonei i guess his way of telling me hey im here im glad to see you im doing okay and ill believe that till my dying day i i if i could do anything id want to give him a hug i miss his hug i still remember his hug he gave bear hug and they were just the best hug ihes the person you would have wanted to be friend withi i i i like how my aunt put it on his headstone he wa a gentle soul thats what he wa big friendly giant i i\",\n          \"script info title default file scripttype v wrapstyle
